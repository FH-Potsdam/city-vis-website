<h2>2022 Call for Urban Visualization Projects</h2>


<strong>Following our first two successful competitions in 2016 and 2018, this third iteration is looking for the latest projects in the field of urban data visualization.</strong>


Visualization as a tool for analysis, exploration and communication has become a driving force in the task of unravelling the complex urban fabrics that form our cities. More than half of the worldâ€™s citizens are living in urban areas, with a steady growth for the years ahead. The complexity of the processes at hand calls for methods and tools that help better understand the urban realm and the underlying relationships and connections, for all stakeholders involved, from urban planners to decision makers to companies and citizens themselves. Visualization experts around the world are working on new techniques in the hope of making these urban processes more transparent and understandable. The goal of this competition is to bring together the wide spectrum of work in urban visualization across disciplinary and professional boundaries and honour particularly innovative and important projects.
