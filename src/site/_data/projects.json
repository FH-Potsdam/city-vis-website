It develops upon a never seen hyper granular map that returns the climate of more than 100.000 EU municipalities in a single view. Such detail allows visitors to search for their places, the ones they care about, shortening the distance between the EU citizens and the global phenomenon. Then, a scroll-based page narrates the chosen municipality's climate trend. It connects the single place with the surroundings and then the connected provinces and region connecting again local climate with a broader scope. Finally, more than 100.000 informative data thumbnails were  generated, one for each place, turning visitors in little digital activists toward a greater climate awareness.",

Applying artificial intelligence methods to local news sources, GLOCON provides and visualizes a number of contentious political level characteristics: event type, (e.g strikes, rallies, boycotts, protests, riots, and demonstrations, i.e. the “repertoire of contention”), participant type (student, worker, militant, etc), organizer type (union, political party, armed organization, NGO etc), ethnicity, urban/rural. GLOCON is one of the major results of a broader project, called Emerging Welfare (EMW). Funded by European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant, EMW has been led by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Erdem Yoruk, from Koc University, since January 2017.Here, we employ advanced computing techniques such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning in order to extract protest data from online news sources. The GLOCON team has developed fully automated tools for document classification, sentence classification, and detailed protest event information extraction that perform in a multi-source, multi-context protest event setting with consistent performances of recall and precision for each country context. GLOCON's visualization allows the user to observe the distribution of detailed event characteristics over time and space.   ",

My project intends to empower and motivate the urban population to act by providing qualitative data sets in a descriptive and accessible way about sustainability in public space.  The global consequences of climate change are increasing year by year. We are running out of time and yet global agreements and measures seem to be making only slow progress. The 1.5°C climate target set in the Paris Climate Agreement is being postponed further and further. And yet humanity depends on not exceeding this limit. The IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C Global Warming articulates the urgent need to take the limit seriously: \"The impacts of 1.5°C global warming on nature and humanity will be higher than they already are today, but significantly less than they would be at 2°C.\" Climate change is an issue that is relevant to all of us, as we share responsibility and our basis of life is threatened.  I apply data visualisations that are showing these consequences with semi permanent spray chalk to table-tennis tables in public city spaces. A QR code refers to the data basis and explains in more detail how the data is derived. In parks, a cross-section of society can be found, as they are democratic places available to all citizens for recreation. Exactly therefore I consider this place very suitable. As a recurring element in the city with standardized masses I have the possibility to reproduce my motives.",

In order to make the city friendlier and more inclusive for all species, alternative city concepts that truly offer living space for all can be developed on an experimental basis. In the game, all players work together to build a city that corresponds to their imagination using various structural and natural building blocks. Thereon species cards are assigned, which are now to be represented with the help of additional natural elements. The cards contain information about the needs of the species, for example regarding habitat and food. Since the species used do not necessarily always harmonize with each other, conflicts can arise for which solutions must be sought in discourse. After the players decide that the city is finished, a small evaluation round by means of a recorded discussion follows. Additionally the board is photographed. This creates an accessible, qualitative data collection which is documented on the website.",

    "project_description": "Back in the 1970s, activist Jane Jacobs theorized urban vitality and found that there are four conditions required for the promotion of life in cities: diversity of land use, small block sizes, concentration of people, and mix of economic activities. Without them, a city will die. With them, it will flourish.  With modern technologies, high pedestrian activity is, nowadays, captured from multiple sources - from mobile phones to surveillance cameras to even social media. Unfortunately, all these sources are virtually unavailable as they are held by private companies. What can be accessed by everyone? The sky!  Our project investigated whether it was possible to predict and visualize urban vitality based on one, openly available source: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. First, we developed a state-of-the-art deep-learning framework to predict vitality scores in six Italian cities: Bologna, Florence, Milan, Palermo, Rome, and Turin. Second, we utilized image processing techniques and color frequency analysis to design a visual essay, that unfolds the connections between the vitality levels, unique city colors and typical urban features. The essay is told through four interactive visualizations: color swatches, deep-learning framework explanations, urban DNA stripes and dot grid maps. These vitality depictions are easily understandable for urban dwellers and democratize access to hidden vitality discoveries.",

Besides purely navigation purposes, street names also reflect a city’s culture through its commemorative practices. Therefore, cultural maps that unveil socio-cultural characteristics encoded in street names could potentially raise citizens’ historical awareness. But designing effective cultural maps is challenging, not only due to data scarcity but also due to the lack of effective approaches to engage citizens with data exploration. To address these challenges, we collected a dataset of 5000 streets across the cities of Paris, Vienna, London, and New York, and built their cultural maps grounded on cartographic storytelling techniques. Cultural maps engage uses and allow them to discover distinct patterns in the ways these cities are gender-biased, celebrate various professions, and embrace foreign cultures.",

By exploring the data, you can get an impression of how likely it has been for people from a certain country of origin to be granted or denied asylum in Europe. Two European countries of asylum can be compared at a time. Furthermore, the fragmentation of asylum decisions beyond recognized and rejected is inherently visible due to the further categories of complementary protection and otherwise closed. Beyond the comparison of relative proportions between decision categories within a country as well as between countries, the absolute figures of decisions are set in relation to the number of inhabitants of each chosen country. This can give you an understanding of how high or low the number of decisions is and puts the number into perspective. Another aspect the web app allows you to investigate is that of temporal evolutions in decisions from 2000 until last year.",

    "project_description": "Data on urban issues is becoming much more important, both in managing time and resources and in shaping the future. In times of smart cities, urban planners who have to deal with data visualisation on a daily basis are among the most important actors. In addition, there is the highly collaborative interdisciplinary expert world of designers, programmers, engineers, architects and planners in the field of urban development.  Not only the experts, but also the economy, citizens and politicians want something \"visible\".  In this master’s thesis I have developed an interactive map for the urban development project Berlin-Tegel Airport (TXL), directly with Tegel Projekt GmbH. The basic idea is to investigate the relevance and usefulness of web GIS for urban planning. The core of the thesis is concerned with the question of how modern urban planning processes can be supported by data-based tools. The master’s thesis examines the interplay between modern visualisation tools and classical urban planning activities. The content and connectivity of the work is starting from the content of urban planning studies, bridges to methods of design and software development, to geoinformatics and data science. The Web-GIS mapping tool for the Berlin TXL clearly demonstrates the benefits of Open Data and its possibilities for advanced geodata visualisation and for supporting collaborative planning and development processes. The methodical process from data analysis, user-centred design, surveys, the conception and evaluation of a prototypical mapping tool is exemplary. As a result, the use of interactive maps in planning is given not enough attention, although digital mapping tools support collaborative working. Future research could work on the aspect of collaborative working by facilitating the integration of interdisciplinary exchange through web-based mapping technologies. ",

Thailand had relied on foreign visitors for its overall economic growth. Amidst stagnant international arrivals, a stronger domestic tourism sector can be a solution.  However, Thailand does not have many public data sources on tourism business and tourist behavior. Through partnership between Boonmee Lab, DTAC, and Faculty of Architecture, Chulalongkorn University, we aim to utilize mobility data to understand the current state of domestic tourism and devise a data-driven strategy to promote local tourism.  We aggregated Call Detail Record (CDR) into trips and visualized them in a modified FlowmapBlue. After back-and-forth analysis and discussion sessions, we found some regional trip patterns which were different from conventional tourism clusters by solely historical, educational, or geographical purposes.  With further analysis, we will publish a full report, produce communication materials, and host a forum with our partner organizations to disseminate the results. A limited version of our map tool will also be released for public use. We hope this project can lead to data-driven development of domestic tourism in Thailand.",

    "project_year": "2022",
    "project_description": "Utilizing open-source research data for autonomous vehicles, AUTO-NOM investigates how a self-driving car perceives the urban landscape, and how us humans can reshape our perception of the city by looking at it through the lens of an autonomous vehicle.   In this Virtual Reality experience, the viewer takes a 15 minute ride through central Munich from the point of view of an autonomous research vehicle. What they see however, is a visualization of the point-cloud data the car’s 3D sensors have recorded. This data, corresponding to hundreds of gigabytes, is represented by hundreds of thousands of small monochromatic cubes, which results in an abstract, three-dimensional, 360 degree image of the car’s surroundings. In addition, AI object recognition annotations have been layered on top of this 3D animation. This was done using AI image processing software on the car’s 2D camera footage, replicating the way an autonomous vehicle algorithmically processes its environment. Further non-visual sensor information such as acceleration data has been transformed into an underlying soundscape using sonification software.  Viewing an urban environment in the way an autonomous vehicle would, gives us the opportunity to look at the city differently and re-evaluate. For example, one might interpret the way humans morph into indistinguishable silhouettes, while the shape of cars and other vehicles stay relatively detailed and recognizable, as mirroring the hierarchy of a typical car-centric city. While possibly being safer than human drivers in the future, the need of robotic cars for error-free assessment of a situation might require more clean, segregated traffic infrastructure. This could conflict with the nature of many European city centers, possibly undoing recent progress of making urban infrastructure less car-centric.   The original format of this project is a real-time VR experience using the Unity game engine running on a high-end PC. To make it accessible without the need for powerful hardware, it has been submitted as a high-resolution 360 degree 3D video and as such is viewable on a number of devices, including standalone VR headsets and mobile devices. This project originated as a student submission for a class at the Institute of Media and Design (IMD) of Technische Universität Braunschweig and has been exhibited at Architekturgalerie München in June 2022. It uses data from the Audi Autonomous Driving Dataset (A2D2) licensed under Creative Commons, see https://a2d2.audi. The authors are not affiliated with Audi AG in any way.",

The task was completed by a team of researchers and professionals from various fields, including art historians, archaeologists, architects, epigraphers, historians, photographers (one of which is also an archaeologist), web design and visualization experts. The main aspects of the project are as in below: •     Visual documentation of the existing walls surrounding the “Historical Peninsula” of Istanbul (app. 22 km in length). Every piece of the city walls (curtain wall, towers and gates) have been photographed from every possible angle by professional photographers with over 6.000 photographs. Documentation also included video recordings from air by drone following the whole line of the sea and land walls. •     Mapping the architectural units of the walls based on GPS coordinates, as accompanied by visual documentation and concise written descriptions. •     Producing up-to-date scientific essays by the experts to reveal the past and current situation of the monument. •     Studying the relation of the walls to the modern city, both physically and culturally; the impact of the walls on life and culture of the city (example: walls in modern Turkish movies). •     Providing up-to-date visual and textual sources for the future restoration/conservation works. •     Sharing all the data globally. The site is bilingual (Turkish and English). •     Presenting a visually explicit and convenient tool for website visitors.  ",

This makes it very hard to paint a clear picture of our reality and calculate the relevant metrics to measure the opportunities and impacts to society of improving urban mobility. The most common problems with current solutions are not standardized data and typologies, data not being available publicly, or sometimes data not existing at all.  UCB (Brazil Cyclists Union) and ITDP (Institute for Transport and Development Policy) are two influential civil society organizations that have joined forces to solve once and for all these problems. We've developed the first cycling maps platform encompassing all Brazilian cities, leveraging the open data and collaborativeness of OpenStreetMap (OSM). We've created an open-source web application, free and accessible from any computer or smartphone, aimed at both the average citizen, who wants to know more about their city, and researchers, who now have easy access to this data without needing OSM knowledge.  On the newly released version of the website we even took a step further from just making the data available and launched a new Metrics section. Following a \"show don't tell\" logic, we are giving examples of what you can do when you have this data in your hands. For the time ever it's now possible to check in real time the total length of cycling infrastructure in all Brazilian cities. Knowing, however, how limited and misleading this metric alone can be, we joined forces with other institutions that develop other important metrics, such as the PNB (People Near Bike), which measures how accessible the infraestruture is to people, and IDEciclo, which measures its quality.  In conjunction with the platform, we're organizing educational programs to evangelize and educate people on how to contribute with OSM, thus empowering citizens to take part in this collaborative process and gaining ownership of our cities' data.",

The book includes 18 infographics based on data visualization adressing topics such as the relationship between the city and its rivers, the overwhelming urban sprawl of São Paulo, the recent already perceptible change in meteorological events and the possibilities to develop urban resilience. It is a reminder that a smart city is the one that fosters ways to adapt and thrive in face of the climate crisis.  The full work contains a report explaining the methodology used in each infographic, as well as their references.",

For decades, the field of urban morphology has sought to unveil, measure and study these relations to learn more about the evolution of the city form. At the same time Social media has become a common feature of our everyday life. For researchers, social media provides large amounts of readily accessible, on-time and qualitatively rich data that can be used to study urban activities and people?s interactions. The specific characteristics of different forms of social media, such as Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare, open different avenues for both quantitative and qualitative analysis.\r\n\r\nIn this work we are aim to hack the invisible city, leverage the secret strengths of urban spaces, and explore how the many characters, all the different layers of the urban fabric come together.\r\n\r\nAiming to combine art and science to study urban phenomena, SPIN Unit has coalesced into an international network of professionals.

The tweets are aggregated to hexagonal grid cells to visualize activity density in different Central London areas. The results of the mapping illustrate very high densities at the beginning and endpoints of the protest (the Bank of England and Parliament Square). Additionally, there are high tweet densities in the West End and Bank than in other neighbouring areas.\r\nThis interaction between urban space and Internet Communication (ex. social media) is expected to be strengthened in the future as ICTs technology will be developed and people will participate in diverse issues more than before.",

The programme supports the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing and other public and private partners to improve access to sustainable energy in the country. In cooperation with the Rainer-Lemoine Institute, NESP is conducting applied research on geo-spatial electrification planning in Nigeria, utilizing advanced modelling tools. The goal is to identify sustainable and economically viable options (e.g. grid, off-grid, solar home systems) for non-electrified urban and rural areas and to advance electrification planning methods.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the exploration and communication of research results and different planning scenarios to all stakeholders is of paramount importance for the further utilization and implementation of the results. The Interactive Electrification Planning Map (IEPM) for Nigeria is an exploratory mapping tool geared towards that purpose. It allows users to interactively explore the current situation of electrification coverage in the country and acts as a strong visual vehicle to effectively disseminate knowledge and create attention among (non-GIS/non-technically oriented) stakeholders. The ultimate goal is to deepen involvement from all stakeholders, i.e. government, NGOs and the private sector.\r\n\r\nA first interactive prototype of the IEPM tool for Plateau state has recently been developed. It is currently being tested and disseminated both among authorities and electrification experts in Germany and Nigeria. Further development will follow to incorporate feedback and enhance the tool's functionalities (i.e. add filtering, greater geographic coverage).\r\n\r\n",

    "project_description": "What happens when you layer a science project on top of a walking tour on top of an art experiment on top of an archival map on top of demographic data on top of a memoir? What if the archives of multiple universities and other institutions could be accessed on one platform and layered with the projects, stories, and data from researchers, teachers, students, and community groups? \r\n\r\nThe http://ATLmaps.com project attempts to answer these questions. The platform, a collaboration between Georgia State University and Emory University, combines archival maps, geospatial data visualization, and user contributed multimedia location pinpoints to promote investigation into any number of issues about Atlanta. While currently focused on one city to demonstrate the power of stacking thousands of layers of information on one place, this innovative online platform will eventually allow users to layer an increasing number of interdisciplinary data to address the complex issues that any city poses. The project looks to offer a framework that incorporates storytelling reliant on geospatial data and for normalizing input across a range of data sets so that material can be cross-compared in novel ways, allowing users to make connections between seemingly unrelated data sources and ask questions that would not be apparent when only looking at one particular project. The ATLmaps project will also encourage knowledgeable members of the university and local communities to curate data on the site to demonstrate the possibilities for synthesizing material across projects and data types. \r\n\r\nMost large-scale mapping projects focus on one of three approaches: offering a collection of georeferenced archival maps, providing a way to visualize spatial data, or creating a platform for curated multimedia storytelling through location markers and guided tours. Some projects use a mixture of these methods to explore a particular problem or issue. Businesses, government agencies, community groups, and universities are collecting location-based data and producing incredible mapping projects. ATLmaps is being built as a platform to provide, create, curate, and layer all of these efforts.\r\n\r\nThe ATLmaps platform is currently under heavy development, but already houses over 2,000 map layers and a growing number of projects. Projects such as Religious Sounds, Stadiumville, and ATLas are being used in classrooms, at community meetings, and for art exhibits. As we see increased demand for our platform, we need to figure out how to move forward on several key issues, which we have received Knight Foundation funding to work on over the next year:\r\n\r\n?\tBuilding better search functionality\r\n?\tCreating walking tours\r\n?\tAdding large dataset layers\r\n?\tAdding more content from our library collections\r\n?\tAllowing users to create and save projects\r\n?\tCollaborating with universities in other cities\r\n\r\nLibraries have more than just books. But until recently, important collections, because they are often rare, fragile, or unwieldy, were effectively unavailable to most of the public. Maps, photos, and manuscripts have been available to a small number of professionals who knew these collections existed and understood how to use them. Digitization is radically opening up access to these holdings, but this is only the first stage in making them useful to the public. The ATLmaps project seeks to not only provide access to resources, but also to create a platform that allows users to curate, layer, and use these collections across institutional boundaries.\r\n\r\nATLmaps has its roots in digitization projects at Emory and GSU. At Emory much of this process was centered on the digitization of a 1928 Atlas of Atlanta and Vicinity, which was the most comprehensive topographic mapping of the city. Over several years Emory students and staff produced a geodatabase with several thematic layers including the street networks, streetcar and rail lines, and building footprints to name a few. The digitization of map collections at Emory has opened new avenues to explore the original content and has amplified the opportunities in the area of digital heritage of Atlanta. The GSU Library is also a leader in digital library collection development. One example is the NEH funded Planning Atlanta collection, which consists of over 2000 georeferenced city planning maps and 460 city publications, recent and historical local demographic data, photographs depicting planning activities, oral histories, and aerial photographs. GSU digital collections are allowing students, educators, and the public to engage with their local surroundings and to connect the current built environment and the past.\r\n \r\nATLmaps advances the library field by providing an open source, web-based story map application that invites users to engage simultaneously with content across not only multiple collections, but most significantly, across multiple library institutions. While the Digital Library of America allows for aggregated, multi-institutional search, ATLmaps differs in that, while it also provides multi-institutional content search, ATLmaps allows users to directly engage with and see potentially hidden spatial connections in the material ? all within its map interface. This allows for unprecedented ways of engaging with and enhancing material across institutions. Another distinguishing feature of ATLmaps is that it allows users to create stories with the content directly in the ATLmaps platform, thus making the need for downloading content and bringing it into another software application unnecessary. This open source, multi-institutional platform advances the library field because it helps to breakdown unnecessary barriers between libraries and provides the end-user, who is likely more interested in content than in collections by library, with more meaningful access to digitized material.\r\n\r\nThe ATLmaps platform already has users who are students, teachers, researchers, community groups, government workers, and planning firms. By addressing usability issues and adding new features, we will better be able to serve their needs. The best way to define our audiences is to describe a couple of the projects already on the site. As more content is added to the site and more projects are created, we imagine that our audience will grow considerably.\r\n\r\nStadiumville seeks to tell the stories of the neighborhoods around Turner Field as the Atlanta Braves prepare to leave for the suburbs. The project was an early test case for the platform because it sought to connect two seemingly disconnected groups of layers- pinpoints documenting an art project in 2013 and planning maps from the 1950s and 1960s. The neighborhoods in this area have been drastically and repeatedly reshaped because of 3 interstates, 2 massive stadiums, acres of parking lots, white flight, and urban renewal funds. The project has been used in classes at GSU and Georgia Tech to discuss urban renewal. Community groups have used the maps to show the detrimental effects on their neighborhoods because of poor planning decisions in the past. Perkins and Will, a planning firm hired to work with these neighborhoods, the city, and developers has displayed the Stadiumville project at public meetings. Data and stories they are collecting about the community?s hopes for the redevelopment of the area will be added as layers to the platform. An urban geography professor at Kennesaw State University recently contacted the project team to see if his students could begin creating layers connected to the project.\r\n\r\nA few strong examples of smaller projects demonstrate other current and potential audiences. 1)The Atlanta Art Scene map project is part of an art exhibit focused on Atlanta women who helped shape the city?s art community in the 1970s. Using the memories of eight women from the period who continue to shape arts in the city today, faculty and staff from the Universities of West Georgia, Kennesaw State, and Georgia State mapped the places important to the arts world forty years ago. 2)The Religious Sounds Map project documents the sounds associated with various religious communities, events, and individual practices in metropolitan Atlanta. Students, supervised by a Religious Studies professor at GSU, make the digital sound recordings as a class project and the layers will be expanded as more classes participate. 3)Years before ATLmaps existed, a local historical society had created a walking tour documenting the past presence of an African-American community in a now mostly-white neighborhood. A representative from the group learned about ATLmaps, allowed our team to upload their tour, and added an archival race map from our collection. \r\n\r\nAll of these projects allow users not only to find material, but to also add to, mash up, and curate a growing collection.",

This short documentary film (18 minutes) describes the results of a research project at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, and shows how this issue plays out in the small city Leh in the Indian Himalaya: very rapid economic growth and ensuing fast urban transformation have caused a huge water supply and wastewater management challenge in a region where water is already scarce, with concomintant health risk. An alternative to the planned centralized sewage system is to recycle and reuse wastewater decentrally for urban agriculture, thereby conserving water and energy resources and supporting food security as part of a climate change adaptation strategy. With such an approach, Leh can be a model for future urban development for cities worldwide.\r\n\r\nLink: https://vimeo.com/142941443\r\nPassword: wefnexusleh\r\n",

However, architectural theory is yet to find methods of urban analysis that are appropriate to the discipline, while building bridges with other disciplines that deal with urban space. This project analyses streets. The project began in 2011 with the graphic analysis of streets in plan and section. Now it has evolved to include different types of analysis coming from disciplines as diverse as sociology, history, geography, sound, art, as well as architecture and urban design. The project went through a process of experimentation,  in Belfast, Buenos Aires, Edinburgh and Kilkenny.  This exercise has enhanced local student?s understanding of the role of streets in the urban landscape while building a critical mass of examples to inform the analysis.\r\n \r\nThe wider StreetSpace project is underway through an interdisciplinary reading group and taught modules in the Masters in Architecture. There are plans for carrying out the interdisciplinary workshop in a series of cities in Europe and South America.",

    "project_description": "The city of Rio de Janeiro has undergone a series of transformations from 2009 to 2016, since it was chosen as the first South American city to host the Olympic Games. After a long period of economic and cultural stagnation, a sequence of mega-events (including the 2014 FIFA World Cup) led to a boom of projects in this city of 6.3 million inhabitants. In addition to the Olympic installations, there are new museums, hotels, public spaces, real estate ventures, infrastructure projects and a mega restructuring of the port area. However, many promises ? such as the cleanup of Guanabara Bay and the urbanization of 260 favelas ? were ultimately broken. And an astonishing number of 22,000 families faced forced evicitions to make way for Olympic works.\r\n\r\nThis process brought together public and private agents, who invested in different models of partnerships. Once again, the appeal of ?modernization? was used to justify a model of interventions strongly anchored in architecture, at a huge financial, social and environmental cost. But how much innovation was accomplished by these projects, and which ones are worthy of the architecture and urban spaces this city has produced in the past? Which alternatives were presented for the highly predatory model that rules many large cities today? To what extent do these projects and interventions effectively contribute to promote equality? What level of involvement did society have? And what kind of city will become of this, in the end?\r\n\r\nWe invite everyone to seek answers to these questions in the website rionow.org, which represents the results of an extensive research, developed within the Department of Architecture and Urbanism at PUC-Rio/ Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. \r\n\r\nIn order to follow the pace of transformations imposed by the calendar of the Olympics, and be able both to track and unravel this process in its full complexity, we had to find new ways of exploring and visualizing urban data. Our challenge was to a create a tool that allows for a critical and multifaceted reading of the whole process involved in Rio de Janeiro's transformation in the last 7 years. Due to the lack of transparency that involved the whole process, we soon realised the importance of data visualization.\r\n\r\nThe main feature of the research became thus a timeline beginning in October 2009 when Rio won the Olympic bid. More than just document the buildings and infrastructure projects ushered in by the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games, the timeline uses multiple sources to showcase the complex transformations happening in both Rio and Brazil.  \r\n\r\nThe website, which was launched on the same day of Rio 2016 opening ceremony, also includes a list of 100 projects and works developed in Rio de Janeiro, a map locating main projects and works developed in Rio de Janeiro, critical texts by different authors and exclusive interviews related to urban transformations in Rio de Janeiro, forming a panel of multiple versions of events, from the perspective of different actors/agents. There is also a newspaper designed to be distributed in public spaces in Rio de Janeiro during the Games.\r\n\r\nWe hope this will contribute to turn visible the process of urban transformation of the city of Rio de Janeiro due to mega events culminating with the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Because the game isn?t over, nor will it end when the torch blows out.\r\n",

The parcels caught up in this web of speculation are spread across the city and come in a variety of forms. At their worst these owners are buying and selling houses that rapidly decline into vacant and abandoned shells.\r\n\r\nToo often neighborhoods and the public are forced to bare the cost of these activities from the daily reality of physical deterioration, to declining property values, and increasingly costly demolitions. The recent mortgage crisis created a large inventory for speculation while most government response at the federal, state and local level is dedicated demolishing the aftermath of these activities. What is not addressed is the production and producers of these conditions.\r\n\r\nThis project demonstrates the scope and actors producing the landscapes of vacancy and abandonment in Detroit and provides a strategic instrument for residents attempting to challenge speculative activity in their neighborhood. Property praxis is a data and design collective. All work is open source and freely available to those interested in developing similar tools in their cities.",

    "project_description": "Researchers have used large quantities of online data to study dynamics in novel ways. Consider the specific case of online networked individuals (e.g., users of Twitter, Instagram, Flickr). Can their social dynamics be used to build better tools for future cities? To answer this question, our research has focused on understanding how people psychologically experience cities. As a result, we have created new mapping tools that leverage senses and emotions, thus complementing the idea of an efficient and predictable smart city, with the ultimate goal of reaching urban happiness. The project presented mixes data mining, urban informatics, and computational social science to show how a creative use of social media and network-generated data can capture the sensorial layers of our cities at scale.\r\n \r\nHumans are able to potentially discriminate millions of different odors. Yet, city officials and urban planners deal only with the management of few bad odors. This negative and oversimplified perspective comes from the difficulty of measuring smell at scale: cities are victims of a discipline?s negative perspective. The goal of Smelly Maps is to open up a new stream of research that celebrates the complex smell fragments of our cities, by contributing to the development of a critical voice for the positive and negative roles that smell has to play in the design of a city. \r\n\r\nTo create the smellscape of a city, first we created a lexicon of smell-related words. We then obtained social media photos geo-referenced in the urban area that matched our lexicon. Depending on where those photos were taken, we mapped the presence of smell categories in each street segment. Smelly Maps illustrates the smellscape of 12 cities around the world, each street is colored with the most characteristic smell in the area, while a click on a street segment shows the entire distribution of smells categories and the corresponding emotional response. In the same direction, we mapped the visual and sonic (Chatty Maps) footprints of a city; maps are available  within the goodcitylife.org initiative. ",

For a more general audience, the tool?s visualization output can inform collective behaviors and offer the possibility to participate and influence global trends. It allows to investigates questions such as:\r\n\r\n- Can we find repeating dynamical patterns?\r\n- How are these patterns affected by specific events?\r\n- Can we differentiate specific spatial areas with their activity patterns?\r\n- Which are the similarities and difference between major cities in different parts of the world?\r\n\r\nThe application currently browses mobile phone traffic patterns in London, New York, Hong Kong and Los Angeles during a 10 month period going from April 2013 to January 2014. More specifically, the records consist in network level counter data that includes the numbers of calls, SMS and data requests, as well as the amount of data uploaded and downloaded by subscribers (measured in Bytes).

    "project_title": "Open Data Innovation: Harnessing 3D Visualization Technology for Smart Urban Growth",
    "project_year": "2015",
    "project_description": "In 2014, the City of Toronto released its city-wide 3D Massing Model as Open Data for the first time. That same year, research revealed that Toronto had more high-rise buildings under construction than any other city in North America, outnumbering New York two subsequent years in a row (Source: The Huffington Post Canada). With increased development activity under review in 2015, the City wanted to engage more residents in community consultations and expand its engagement tool box. \r\n\r\nWith a focus on engagement with 3D visualization, the 2015 release of the 3D Massing Model in a new file format enabled us to work with our applicants in the development community to create improved visuals for development review that are consistent, recognizable and better understood by the public. \r\n\r\nThis was a milestone for the City. Implementing cross-sector graphic standards for 3D visualization resulted in efficiencies in the time and cost required to create visual materials. Within the City's specific context, all business and public sector organizations are required by law to comply with provincial accessibility laws such as the AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act). These laws provide guidance for compliance and set the framework for how municipalities operate.   \r\n\r\nUsing principles of clear language and accessible design, a new development notification sign that features the graphic standards, showing a 3D view of a proposal within its proper urban context was developed. \r\n\r\nA development notice sign at a major intersection within Toronto's downtown receives approximately 24,500 views on a typical day between 7:30am and 6:30pm. The signs reach a vast audience and are an important component of public engagement for the City of Toronto. Improving these signs by replacing technical drawings with simplified 3D massing views became a priority to help us achieve our engagement goals.      \r\n\r\nWhile developing our graphic standards, creating a model stylization with input from residents and stakeholders that incorporated a colour blind compliant colour palette was one of the challenges we overcame. The simplified model stylization was also tailored for viewing across both print and digital mediums, and includes optimized responsive design viewing through websites and social media platforms that work with a range of devices. Through the stylization developed, we are able to convey technical information about proposals including building height and setbacks, shadow impacts, and separation distances within context while meeting accessibility standards. \r\n\r\nThese efforts to enhance visual communication are especially important in Toronto, where more than 180 languages and dialects are spoken. 49.1% of Toronto?s population had a non-English mother tongue during the last Census, while 5% of the population knew neither official language, English or French. \r\n\r\nThis Census information informed the design of the new sign, which now features minimal text descriptions of a proposed development, relying instead on the graphic standards created to communicate key information and help engage city residents.\r\n \r\nOur 3D Massing Model in Open Data helps improve outcomes for communities by providing data infrastructure and tools that support evidence-based urban planning. The visualizations created from our 3D Massing Model help City staff provide data-driven, objective evidence and advice to help City Council make informed decisions that will protect the needs of individuals and the communities they serve. \r\n\r\nDeveloping cross-sector graphic standards for communicating the data in a clear and concise manner has been a significant step forward in helping to meet the needs of our target audience. The resulting visualizations help everyone become better-informed and engaged in the decision-making process about how to improve and shape the urban realm, for both policy-makers and city residents.

    "project_description": "cf. city flows is a comparative visualization environment of urban bike mobility designed to help citizens casually analyze three bike-sharing systems in the context of a public exhibition space. Three high-resolution screens show the space of flows of New York City, Berlin, and London through visualizing the bike-sharing systems of these global cities. By showing the flow of multiple cities side by side, we can compare their extent and dynamics. Tracing urban movements accentuates different urban structures, and contrasts grid-plan cities like New York with historically grown cities such as Berlin. It also enables us to observe and dwell on similarities and differences in various bike-sharing systems. With our visualizations we want to understand the pulse of urban mobility and create portraits of a city defined by its transient dynamics.\r\n\r\nCycling is increasingly recognized as critical component of future urban mobility. Riding a bike is largely independent of other traffic and unaffected by road congestion, and has health and environmental benefits. In the last few years, many cities around the world installed bike-sharing systems in order to stimulate casual use of bicycles by locals and visitors alike. We used data from these systems to visualize various aspects of bike-sharing mobility.\r\n\r\ncf. city flows is an installation that combines multiple visualizations of bike-sharing journeys in three cities. It applies established mapping and visualization techniques within a highly aestheticized framework in order to animate visitors to engage with urban mobility. ",

The database aggregates over 1.7 million rent prices in 22 European countries. The data is collected from flat offers on the open market and from crowdsourcing. Several thousand new data points are added daily to Rentswatch and we already crowdsourced 74 964 rents through a dedicated questionnaire since the launch of our platform. The data is then displayed on a web-based visual interface optimised for mobile.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the platform is to help journalists report on rent prices and give tenants a clearer picture of the housing market. Rentswatch publishes detailed data on rents at the city level in Europe with the same methodology. For each city or neighbourhood, it shows the median price per square meter advertised in classified adverts.\r\n\r\nMost available data on housing relates to home ownership. The German federal statistics office, for instance, offers detailed data on buying prices, but none on rents. Tenants are more likely to be young and less well-off than homeowners. That they should have access to low-quality information gives even more bargaining power to landlords. By providing more and better information, we want to empower people and sustain the public debate.\r\n\r\nRentswatch data have already been used in investigations by European media in Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, France, as well as to highlight the prices of the rent along metro lines in Madrid, Paris and Lille. Thanks to this media coverage and regular updates on social media, we succeeded to gather a community on Facebook and Twitter. ",

The background red eviction dots of the map represent sites of displacement between 1997 and the present. The blue bubbles layered on top are all sites upon which a volunteer of our collective recorded a narrative story. The oral history and video pieces include stories of forced dispossession, neighborhood transformation, and cultural loss, but also narratives of resistance. As such, the map functions as both a neighborhood and cultural archive, and as an activist tool for resistance. Additionally, the map functions to muddy the reductive nature of quantitatively-based mapping, as many of the stories included in the map both confirm and trouble what big data narratives. Collectively, the stories invoke the complexity of gentrification and urban transformation, yet nevertheless highlighting some of the negative effects of late racial capitalism. \r\n\r\nThe map exists online and is available to the public at www.antievictionmappingproject.net/narratives.html. Additionally, we have painted a mural version of in Clarion Alley, which features a call-the-wall function so that viewers can listen to nine of the oral histories featured in portrait form on the wall.",

    "project_description": "This project provided critical insights into how museums could emerge from participatory processes as leaders in a dialectic that framed new creative partnerships between institutions, communities and universities. The research team had an unparalleled opportunity to explore the central research questions by providing workshops in association with the National Museum of Australia's (NMA) travelling exhibition, Freewheeling: Cycling in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe NMA's exhibition used cycling as a prompt to investigate community responses to concerns about ecological footprints, alternative transport and healthy bodies. With cycling as its subject the exhibition illuminated a range of critically important themes related to public health, civic design, gender inequality, obesity, economic development, affordable housing and climate change.\r\n\r\nIn response the researchers delivered one day workshops (charettes) two locations; thus engaging communities in discussion while introducing them to cultural, historic and political contexts which have driven the development of their regions. The workshops were organised under the auspices of the host museum and the outcomes of the project contribute to their understandings of how exhibitions could be used to engage communities in issues of societal concern. \r\n\r\nThe research design for this project was constructed within the framework of ?dialectic engagement? a form of participation which privileges open discussion through which to explores complex ideas. (Fleming & Ostwald, 2005). With its focus on long-ranging discussion, it provided an appropriate method for exploring ethical questions within a context of vernacular, actions and aspirations. It allowed researchers to capture community understandings of their own shared and evolving memories, anxieties and desires.\r\n\r\nThese interactions were collected and mapped using a bespoke visualisation method developed by Dr Fleming. In these new city visualisations, previously underutilised spaces were marked in blue thus identifying visual paths that could, in future, be connected to produce a secondary city, devoted to cycling.

    "project_description": "\"Cities are complex organisms in flux, requiring variable representations and interpretations. Specifically, nighttime turns into a moment of revelation and radicalization of certain urban phenomena. For instance, whereas monuments shape the identity of many contemporary cities, at night these main architectonic symbols fade into darkness. By contrast, entire buildings occupied by banks or hotels emerge as landmarks, uncovering a hidden cultural, economic and political order. Nocturnal and diurnal cities project completely disconnected images, following contrasting hierarchies of values. \r\n\r\nThe ?atNight? project develops new instruments to capture the intangible (i.e. values other than urban plots and facade geometry), taking information from citizens? interactions (actions, activities, emotions) as the basis for planning better nocturnal urban environments both in terms of energy consumption, security, visual image and social identity. We have depicted the city using data from geo-social streams (Twitter, Instagram, Google Local and Flickr) and local open data sources. The research followed several phases, from the design of capture engines, to the management geographic information systems (GIS) data. We allowed parameters to be set and tuned in accordance with the time of the day to interpret the differences between nocturnal and diurnal realities.\r\n\r\nWe could effectively recognise singularities and heterogeneity within the urban fabric. For instance, we obtained divergent densities of data at distinct locations, as well as diverse results when comparing the same values and locations according to the time of the day. In the light of these outcomes, we can visualize how urban activity fluctuates by area and time. This activity becomes measurable and therefore enables comparisons and objective evaluations.\r\n\r\nIt?s crucial to delve into this line of research. Today, urban planning still relies upon traditional cartographic information (topography, plot, division, usage) and neighbourhood-level statistics. These long-established practices are inadequate in comprehending the interaction of citizens. Newly accessible cartographic information will be an inestimable tool for citizen empowerment, enabling individuals to take collective decisions about the intangible cities we inhabit day and night.\"\r\n",

The research examines specifically the necessary urban conditions to promote innovation, the relations established between innovative initiatives, the urban morphology of Barcelona's ecosystem and the transference of knowledge between different areas of the city.\r\n\r\nAs evidenced from the analysis and visualization, one of the strengths of Barcelona's model is the apparently uniform distribution of innovation facilities throughout the city. Urban and environmental conditions (compactness, good communication, cheap rentals, diversity of local services, etc.) have a decisive impact on the location of innovative initiatives giving rise to contrasting economic models.\r\n \r\nAnother significant finding of the research -emerging from the possibility to cross several public datasets from the Open Data Service of Barcelona City Council, the General Directorate for Cadastre, Google Places and Flickr with a database of the top 700 innovative initiatives in the city- is that environmental and morphological factors configure three different spatial models: line, network and centre.\r\n\r\nFinally, the most relevant conclusion of the research is the fact that a diverse and compact urban fabric enables a positive transference of innovation and knowledge to different parts of the city. The data and analysis in this research are intended to help drive evidence-based decisions on which companies and industries should invest in Barcelona ?and other similar cities- and how planning and policy-making can augment this process.

We have increased technical expertise in rehabilitation and society assumes the ?burden? of preserving past legacies for future generations as a moral duty -particularly in European context where architectural heritage is regarded as an economic and strategic value for positioning in global tourism market. \r\n\r\nHowever, a large number of monuments and sites are still at disadvantage. This is the case of Barcelona: minor monuments face significant risks arising from an inadequate dissemination of the Catalog of Heritage. The project 'Big Time Bcn' represents a first attempt to reference, in a dynamic cartographic support (web and mobile), the entire database of Barcelona's heritage to be used by citizens, professionals and foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe cartography includes several existing databases -Directorate General for Cadastre, Barcelona Heritage Catalogue, the Archeological Map- and archives, most of them still to be digitized or opened, melding different data sources into a single and complex representation.\r\n?\r\nThe map, that offers and insight into nearly 70,000 urban plots in contrast to architectural and archaeological heritage, has emerged as a key tool to raise awareness on the collective value of heritage among society and to involve citizens in its safeguarding. \r\n\r\nA real change in the perception of heritage by citizens and tourists should come through the use of tools such as 'Big Time Bcn', that articulate both modern mechanisms of approaching heritage and its cataloging and other identification processes.

The Metropolitan Authority of Barcelona (AMB) is currently drafting a new Metropolitan Urban Master Plan (PDU) -the last General Master Plan for this large conurbation made up with 36 municipalities dates back to 1976. \r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Urban Master Plan (PDU) is a great opportunity to think about the future of the metropolitan city as well as exploring new approaches and tools that are transforming the urban design discipline itself. Introducing contemporary Big Data analysis and visualization as an initial step of a large scale urban design process is a new concept. \r\n\r\n?Barcelona Dynamics? quantifies sociodemographic, economic and morphological aspects of the territory to provide a point of departure for the future metropolitan proposal. The cartographies demonstrate that the mixture of urban uses, constructed forms and economic activities generate a vibrant metropolis. The concentration of inhabitants and workers, the evolution of the urban fabric and the association of certain activities shape the metropolitan landscape. These multiple dynamics can be read under the parameters of Density, Time and Diversity. \r\n\r\nThis process show us a vision that goes beyond the physical space: how urban tangible form is modified by different types of behaviour. From the square meters of growing surface to the income of private companies and the age of population or the number of digital social interactions, we can represent the city by means of data. This datification enables us to integrate multiple information in a unique representation and propose novel urban strategies where form could follows behaviour.  \r\n\r\nThe cartographies in 'Barcelona Dynamics' have been presented in different formats: physical installation, book and interactive visualisation.The project has been exhibited in the DHUB Barcelona Design Museum (Metropolis Barcelona) and the Chicago Arts Institute (Chatter: Architecture Talks Back); it has been included in the publication Metropolis Barcelona () and can be browsed in the online platform Barcelona Dynamics (link).\"\r\n",

    "project_description": "\"The aim of dataWar project is to find new strategies to map territories in conflict situations. During armed conflicts or humanitarian crises, data shall not be trusted. The quality of information could become very poor, partial or even false. The opposing sides usually interpret information depending on their interests. In addition, data generation is a very slow process that could continue well beyond the conflict itself.\r\n\r\nThis is the case of the ongoing war in the Donbass region in Ukraine. The overall number of documented casualties in the conflict, which started in mid-April 2014, now stands at 30,729, including 9,333 killed and 21,396 injured (UN Security Council meeting, 28th April 2016). Numbers vary widely depending on the source: 2,568 civilians were killed from 6 April 2014 to 15 February 2016 according to UN body OCHA while Donetsk People's Republic reports 3,938 civilian deaths in roughly the same period. \r\n\r\nAll methods of the states to capture data disappear because either they exchange their powers or everything stops working. If traditional statistics, giving information on general indicators at a country level, become unable to describe a crisis, new approaches resulting from Big Data analysis and visualization can offer almost a real-time narrative of the conflict. \r\n\r\nFor example, media around the world act a barometer for the situation. Co-operation and human rights associations also report on the evolution of the conflict, and the Internet community, via social networks or collaborative cartography, can describe the problem at smaller scale. These other data sources, that are normally used to describe phenomena at an urban  scale, become essential for accurately illustrating a territory under pressure.  \r\n\r\ndataWar project harvests data from global geo-social streams (GDELT project, United Nations GAR dataset, Open Street Maps, OCHA, Flickr) and local providers (Liveumap, Redonbass), applies mining functionalities, extracts key elements and plots them on a unique cartography that has been exhibited in the 15th International Architecture Exhibition of Biennale Architettura 2016 and can be browsed online (http://architectureukraine.org/datawar/).\"\r\n",

    "project_description": "The Historic Charter of Barcelona is a research project published by means of an online tool, which integrates detailed knowledge about the city history and makes it available to citizens and professionals. \r\n\r\nThe Historic Charter of Barcelona is a tool to explain the history of the city through the cartographies that describe it.  It contains 26 maps that have been drawn from texts, historical cartographies, archaeological maps, modern cartography and contemporary digital maps. A committee of historians specialising in the various historical eras have cross-checked and corrected the documents under the direction of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA). \r\n\r\nThe project also features new contents and geolocates unpublished working documents as the topographical plan that Ildefons Cerdà used to design the Eixample. The documentary sources include maps and aerial photographs from the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia, the Barcelona City History Museum, the Carta Arqueològica de Barcelona, Barcelona Historical Archive, the Cadastre and the Municipal Institute of Informatics (IMI). \r\n\r\nThe redrawing not only facilitates the review and correction of errors in the old cartographies, less accurate, but also provides a graphic representation that is consistent throughout all the stages. This coherence allows the cartographies to be real in parallel and compare the transformations experienced by the city. \r\n\r\nThe tool is public and is online. It allows superimposing maps of various ages, incorporating different information -original working documents and other non-morphological data- and drawing on top of the plans. Thanks to these interaction capabilities, the Historic Charter is a great instrument for communication, pedagogical support and research purposes. \r\n\r\nThe project has a dual dimension: both the content and the cartographic processing/publishing tool, made-to-measure using open source software, which implements a new methodology to streamline and update the information fluently (bug fix, incorporation of new discoveries and historical periods). \r\n\r\nThe Historic Charter of Barcelona is a pioneering tool in the research and dissemination of urban history, making Barcelona the first city in the world to have a tool of this complexity. The Historic Charter is a document aiming to study the history but also to explain it: a tool to think the future by understanding the past.\r\n",

    "project_description": "In the context of the Open Data revolution, we are experiencing a Data Divide affecting the most vulnerable segments of society. Today, extreme poverty is a question still to be digitised in almost every city in the world. As people living in the streets is not usually covered by any census, homeless have became invisible. In this regard, the quantification of homelessness impact on society is a first step towards stopping poverty and social exclusion. Having the means to measure the true extent of the problem is key to develop appropriate policies (number of needed beds, capacity of shelters, evolution of homelessness, etc.). \r\n\r\nBut how do you count the homeless? There are few experiences to map poverty besides conducting official, slow and expensive households surveys. Still, the best way to count rough sleepers in urban areas is to comb the streets, as the accuracy of the obtained data is higher. Major cities such as Los Angeles, London and Barcelona recruit volunteers, every year or every two years, to count homeless in one night. \r\n\r\nOpen Papers, developed by the urban design firm 300.000 Km/s in collaboration with Arrels Foundatiom, arises from the lack of existing workflows and tools to organise, monitor and manage such large-scale datification surveys. The project relies in the power of paper maps and paper forms to collectively gathering data -using mobile phone technologies in large-scale surveys can generate a lack of information due to inaccuracy of GPS or misuse of technology by volunteers.\r\n\r\nOpen Papers allows any organisation to subdivide the city in ad hoc zones, to generate an automatic paper atlas for each team of volunteers -containing a map of the area to explore and a worksheet to collect information- and to digitise the resulting information via image recognition technology. Even if Open papers has been developed for an specific purpose, it has a universal nature and could be used for similar collective processes, such as participatory design of cities and environmental citizen science projects among others.\r\n",

    "project_year": "2015",
    "project_description": "Urban Entropy by Dietmar Offenhuber, is an auditory display of complaining and repair, as on-going and necessary as the dynamics of the never-stable and continuously developing city. The installation ?reads? complaint letters to the local government of the city of Linz through speakers embedded in the fac?ade of the Ars Electronica Center. The complaints are submitted through an online complaint system Schau.auf.Linz (Look at Linz) provided by the city of Linz, using web and smartphone interfaces. The letters are read as they come in by an array of digital voices. The soundscape of these aural complaints are accompanied by simple visualizations of big violet words and numbers on the fac?ade. A random binary pattern on the fac?ade is continuously sorted into regular shapes, until the next incoming complaint frustrates the e ort and the story begins again. By means of these audio and visual translations, people who submit a complaint are made cognizant of the fact that it?s then immediately visible by anyone in the cityscape.\r\nThe main interest of the artist behind this work was the role of citizen complaints in the civic and public space of the city. We often think of the Internet as a form of digital public space that can extend or augment physical public space, but there is certainly an important di erence - if the latter even exists. In physical space, we do not have control over who or what we might run into ? a friend, or a person we would rather not like to interact with. Writers such as Jane Jacobs and Richard Sennett saw this ?forced exposure to diversity? as a defining quality of public space, which does not exist in segregated suburbs or gated communities. From this perspective, the Internet is more like a gated community ? we will only find what we explicitly look for, keeping everything else outside our personal filter bubble. Since the complaint letters directly address civic issues, they should be part of public space. Through this intervention, the artist wanted to recreate this experience in a manner of ?forced exposure?. ?Entropy? is a concept that refers to the amount of disorder in a physical system. The title Urban Entropy was chosen to indicate that the city is always a work in progress, never complete, always a bit broken, and constantly being\"fixed\".\r\nAt the time of realizing the work, the complaint system in Linz had been in place for several months, and people were starting to use it. When reviewing the com- plaints, one could see that there were many topics of crucial importance emerging through this medium. A key question was whether the tone and arguments of the complainers would change if they knew that their reports would be read from the Ars Electronica Center fac?ade (they were otherwise published on the website). The results could go either way ? some people might reconsider and tone down their letters in response, other might seize the opportunity of having a larger, captive audience.\r\nThe project was created during a residency for the Connecting Cities conference and the Soundframe festival. Ars Electronica Futurelab supported its technical development. The residency in the Futurelab provided an opportunity to exchange with other artists and designers, who were also grappling with the possibilities and limitations of the fac?ade.\r\nrban Entropy was presented at the Connecting Cities conference in early April 2015, the Soundframe festival in Vienna taking place at the same time, and finally at the Ars Electronica Festival in September 2015. An important geographic context is the Ars Electronica Center, which is located immediately opposite the Linz City government building, and so the work benefitted from the appearance that the complaints presented within the artwork might be made directly to the local government. Popular topics concerned for example, issues related to garbage and cleanliness, and public transportation. The results were some- times hilarious. Austrians are very good at complaining, and the sarcasm and irony of the elaborate complaint letters translated perfectly into the emotionless computer voices, which caused more than a few people to crack up on the street. In contrast, on some issues such as complaints about the influx of refugees, the opinions of their writers are not always easy to listen to.\r\nThe work was mostly built upon existing infrastructure. The artist built a java application that connected to the API/ Processing interface for the Ars Electronica Media Fac?ade and the internal interface to the Schau.Auf.Linz data from the city of Linz. The complaints are further analysed and categorized using machine learning techniques. No extra hardware or software was used and everthing worked in real time.\r\n\r\nText from the publication  ?Urban Entropy.?

Each link is a similarity in type along one parameter and cities are grouped based on network modularity or strength of linkages.\r\nB) Footprint reduction trends map: Performance strain is defined as the slope of change in GHG emissions normalized to base year emissions. The colors show strain, the size of the bubble shows total base emissions.\r\nC) City actions profiles: Each city reports anywhere from one to tens of actions they are taking towards footprint reduction. These actions are then categorized along four parameters. The actions profile diagram for each city shows results for six of these parameters.\r\nD) Transition pathway for given city type: Based on what ?action profiles? appear to perform better at reducing emissions, first, second and third priority action recommendations for each city type constitute the ?transition pathway?. This will be used as a first input in a co-production process with city partners and shall be further refined through direct city engagement.\r\n\r\nWe use data from Carbonn, the largest depository of self-reported, voluntary commitments, inventories and actions. Following is the analysis sequence.\r\n\r\n1) Key parameters for classifying cities are identified based on expert and practitioner input.\r\n2) Using the database of inventories the performance is estimated for cities.\r\n3) Using the database of actions cities are taking the ?actions profile? of a city is developed.\r\n4) A decision tree is developed to help cities self-identify their categories.\r\n5) For each city type, based on which ?action profiles? result in best performance a ?transition pathway? is recommended with first, second and third priority action types as well as dependencies.\r\n",

They are all based on nighttime imagery of city lights captured by satellites from the US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP).\r\n\r\nWhat should later become the workhorse of geographers and economists was initially a completely accidental by-product: of a cold-war era military satellite program?launched in the 1950s by the US Air Force for estimating cloud cover and precipitation for reconnaissance missions. Army engineers discovered that the sensors were sensitive enough to capture artificial radiance of cities during moonless nights without cloud cover.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, Thomas A. Croft published the first global composite of night-time images in the Scientific American. At that time, the image data had to be manually stitched together from analog films ejected in capsules from the satellite, which had to be laboriously recovered by the military. Today, the Black Marble data set has become one of the most popular motifs of space imagery.\r\n\r\nWhile DPMS images are usually used to show regional differences, this project visualizes temporal change in urban radiance from 1992 until 2015. It is the first interactive visualization of radiance time series data.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nRadiance information is correlated with country-level GDP and Population data from the UN. To this end, the frequency-normalized satellite composites were re-projected into the equal-area Sinusoidal projection and summarized by brightness. Tools used: R and Qgis\r\n\r\nDespite its robustness for spatial analysis, DMSP composites are noisy data. Original composites contain artifacts originating from gas flares, Aurorae Borealis, variations due to cloud cover and sensor technology. In highly illuminated areas such as Singapore, brightness is clipped to a maximum value. Since the sensors are not calibrated for measuring urban radiance, the resulting values are dimensionless.",

The universal nature, speed and hyper-connectivity of the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have transformed our way of thinking, living and communicating with our environment. The digital transformation has required citizens to acquire new skills to adapt to this new situation. However, factors such as age, education, income level and employment impact this process, giving rise to what has been called the ?digital divide.?\r\n\r\nThe report ?The digital divide in the city of Barcelona?, developed by Mobile World Capital at the request of the Barcelona City Council, is an analysis of the citizens? internet access and usage that aims to measure the city?s level of digitalization in the context of Europe and identify opportunities and scope for development.\r\n\r\nBesides specific conclusions demonstrating a good level of digitisation among the citizenship, the drafting of the report reveals a need for a mechanism to objectively evaluate progress in this task, with enough detail to allow decisions to be made and efforts to be prioritized. So far this kind of study has been conducted at a continent, country or regional level, and this report is an effort to achieve precision at a city level. It also provides a solid base of methodology and data (available in the project website) that can allow progress to be measured and comparisons to be made.\r\n\r\nMeasuring the digital divide in cities was necessary, and Barcelona offers this study and its data to all the cities that share this view. In the same way as countries and regions share evaluation criteria to guide their digital agendas and be able to compare, support each other and learn, cities need a similar analysis mechanism, and this report and its data visualisation aims to be a contribution and a proposal.",

    "project_description": "Geoweb3d\r\n\r\nGeoweb3d is a small business in Binghamton NY that is dedicated to modernizing 3D GIS.  We come from the GIS and flight simulation industries and have decades of experience developing the high end computer graphics that pilots see out the window in a simulator.\r\n\r\nWhy did we create Geoweb3d?\r\nTo bring high end geospatial visualization to the commercial marketplace and to make it easy to use.  Today?s high end 3D visualization solutions are mostly for the military and cost millions of dollars.  They often need a room full of 3D modeling experts, need to preprocess the data into proprietary formats, don?t retain GIS attribution, and break all accuracy to the original data due to thinning of the content for performance.   These solutions are a non-starter for commercial users.\r\n\r\nHow is it different?\r\nBy leveraging today?s video card technology, there is no longer any need to preprocess or restructure the GIS data prior to use.  Here was the opportunity, for the first time, to bring high-end 3D to all users. Users have watched for years what games have been able to do with today?s low cost video cards, but no one made an application for GIS users that can do the same thing with their data.  That is what we did.\r\n\r\nWe developed our technology for 3D geospatial users.  We did not begin as a virtual globe for real-estate, a game engine that was designed for another purpose, or any of the other rebranded products that GIS users are struggling to use their data with. Our software was developed after the gaming technology was mainstream and we built it ground up leveraging the latest in computer graphics technology.\r\n\r\n3D visualization is all about the most effective communication of data. It is by far the quickest method to get to the ?I see? reaction as a descriptive medium. We know that for meaningful visualization and analysis, you need more than just a pretty picture.\r\n\r\nWhat is the product?\r\nGeoweb3d makes 3D easy.  Users do not need to know anything about 3D modeling.  The user interface is simple, contextual, and what people with smart phones or a tablet now expect.  Besides the 3D capabilities, it has built-in a full web browser and ArcGIS. For ESRI users that have a license on their machine, Geoweb3d will provide support for their formats, containers, and server.  If there is no ESRI license, those capabilities are not exposed.  It is not required.\r\n\r\nThe built-in web browser allows for smooth interoperability with cloud and mapping applications such as google maps, google earth, ArcGIS online, and so on.  If it runs in chrome, it will run in Geoweb3d.\r\n\r\nThe application is setup like a web browser where the user can have any number of tabs and each can be a 3D view, a web page, or ArcGIS.  It allows users to drop in their native data, select how they want to look at the data, perform analysis, and save for quick recall and sharing with others.\r\n\r\nWhat does Geoweb3d mean?\r\nOur goal is bring together high end 3D GIS with the web.  The Geoweb is the fusion of geospatial and the web and we want this to seamlessly include 3D.  We want you to discover data easily for your area of interest. We want you to have access to your data in the cloud and to complement the momentum of web GIS to meet the needs of various disciplines that require visualization of very large amounts of data.\r\n\r\nThe image provided is a fusion of GIS, LIDAR, Aerial and Satellite Ortho and Oblique Imagery, and Textured and Non-Textured 3D  Building Models of New York City, New York USA.\r\nOther examples are available at https://www.youtube.com/user/geoweb3d\r\n",

    "project_description": "Porto Alegre, Brazil?s southernmost capital, had, through the last 50 years, a tradition in environmental management to be proud of. The city published an Urban Environment Atlas, created the Participatory Budget, and destined 24% of its territory to specially protected areas. In the last 10 years, however, the municipality grew to neglect the environmental question, and we watched the slow dismantlement of the ideas that molded the city once recognized as Brazil?s greenest capital. \r\n\r\nPorto Alegre?s form and development were, from the start, deeply connected to the landscapes and scenic beauties available (CABRAL, 1978), from the beaches to the hills and now towards the bucolic landscapes currently occupied by rural dwellers. This occupation would be initially lead by the wealthy, which in time ended up bringing the infrastructure that would allow the later occupation of poorer populations. This effect can be observed today in the southernmost portion of the city, once known as the rural zone of Porto Alegre, by luxury condos that carry along with them major urban equipments and mega-infrastructures. \r\n\r\nTo completely understand what this occupation means, the method described by McHarg (1969) is applied. The main atributes, that promote greater value to human occupation when left untouched, were superposed : inundation zones, wetlands, aquifer recharge zones, strong slopes, protected areas, forest patches, agriculture adequate soils, and airport influence areas. \r\n\r\nIn this exercise, one must assume that ecosystem services represent an impossible-to-calculate value. Secondly, if something represents a value, by logical deduction, it must also represent a cost to its users if it were to be destroyed. To calculate this cost without numbers, the same value is addressed to every land atribute, applying the same color and opacity to each one of them. \r\nFrom this color shift, an Urbanization Cost Map can be obtained, in which the darkest areas represent those that support most ecosystem services (provision, regulation, culture and support). When this information is confronted with the roads planned by the city hall and future allotments, one must come to the conclusion that the urban expansion is taking place precisely on the city?s most environmentally relevant areas.\r\n\r\nBesides the information provided by this analysis, one must consider as well that the city has today a habitation deficit of 38 thousand families (living in extreme poverty conditions), and at the same time there are 48 thousand vacant apartments and houses in the inner portion of the urbe. Its Form Index is of about 0.47, which indicates a very inefficient occupation; and the projected densities in the regulating plan, apart from being low, are not practiced by most of the neighborhoods. \r\nTaking all in account, it goes without saying that a more compact occupation model is urgent in Porto Alegre. This compacity, however, has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, scale economies can be obtained - concentration of jobs, greater competition, better quality services-, on the other hand, already existant negative externalities might be enhanced. During the last 5 years, the city was included in the list of municipalities in critical situation regarding the Industry Potencial Pollution Index. The water from its main drinking water source, the Guaíba Lake, is found heavily polluted by domestic and industrial wastewater, and high temperature records are beaten every year. Last but not least, in 2007, the city had doubled the pollution level recommended by the World Health Organization, obtaining, with this, the title of Brazil?s second most polluted capital. \r\n\r\nFrom this insights, one might deduce that as the degree of compacity grows, both the scale economies and the negative externalities curves go up. This suggests that, at some point, one should find a limit degree of compacity; everything beyond this point causes more prejudice than earnings for the city. The ?antidote? for these negative externalities are known as innovation technologies, or sustainable urban systems, such as parks and green-blue infrastructures. This project aims to determine if the application of said systems is possible to be retroactively applied to Porto Alegre?s infrastructure systems. ",

We were able to visualize and further analyze a recent research providing fine grained data on what areas of the world and the US are at risk, the Zika Environmental Sustainability Index (See link 2). This data in conjunction with the Center for Disease Control's data on cases and outbreaks, showed that while at the time there had only been native cases in South America, the estimated possible spread for the year was quite high. We were able to more deeply understand the potentials in various countries of the world by building a dashboard that allowed for index calculations by country (See link 2). Taking a more granular look at the environmental values with data from Natural Earth showed that the index was much higher in urban areas with large populations. Urban factors even contributed to the disease likely being found as far north as New York City.\r\n\r\nWe were interested in understanding how far the Zika virus would spread, and chose to focus on The United States as many of our own family members we're in the southern part of the country. By using US census information juxtaposed against the Zika environmental sustainability index,  we were able to create a dynamic exploratory tool for understanding where populations at highest risk were. The main focus of many campaigns have been targeting women of child bearing age. This is because while the virus shows few symptoms, it has the most severe health impacts on children born from mothers carrying the virus. In addition to that, prevention and education about Zika, as well as medical services, are least available in populated areas with high rates of poverty. The ability to explore these factors visually in the areas with high probability of Zika spread, in addition to interactively being able to navigate specific ratios and locations (See link 1), makes the Zika exposed dashboard a powerful tool for governments and non-profit organizations working with these topics.

    "project_description": "The cities of the future will be rich in sensors and computers which will transform buildings into smart buildings. Such buildings will be equipped with systems that can control their emissions and energy consumption automatically, making cities eco-friendly in ways previously impossible. However many challenges still exist in building such complex control systems. At Imperial College we aim to tackle this through combining mathematics, computer science, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe management of smart buildings can be described with a mathematical problem. If one can solve the problem quickly the smart building will be more efficient, as it will be able to adapt faster to changes in the environment. However, to solve this problem quickly, we need to understand its mathematical structure so that we can transform into a form that is easy for computers to process.  To help us in the development, we use visualisations and the information contained within them.\r\n\r\nIn these visualisations, circles represent \"switches\" or \"knobs\" that are turned on in processes that consume energy, while lines represent connections between these processes. The general shape of the visualisation, for example the presence of separate \"blobs\", gives information on how to partition the solution of the mathematical problem. Regions represented with bright colours describe processes and connections that are more useful to save energy.\r\n\r\nControl systems of the future will be able to analyse the structure of the mathematical problem automatically using new computing technologies that will improve the efficiency of smart buildings.",

The project is inspired by the Gapminder foundation who have been working on visualising data on global developmend and making it accessible to a wider public. In this tool, comparisons between countries has been replaced by small geographical areas in municipalities. There is a pilot version of the tool accessible through the Projects website in Swedish and English, see links below. Five indicators have been selected in the pilot version for the years 2000-2013 which illustrates socio-economic development as well as migration patterns in the region. The aim of the Project is to create a common tool for illustrating differences, similarities and trends between areas in municipalities in the region of Södertörn. The results can also be used to show fact-based data, analyse and benchmark sustainability in municipalities. The goal is to supply municipalities with a common tool where statistics can be visualised and connected to small geographical areas. The Sodertorn Analysis is part of the larger project \"Södertörnsmodellen\" - an innovative collaboration for sustainable urban development in municipalities outside the city centre of Stockholm. One strength is that it is not a flagship development project, but a large area south of Stockholm including different municipalities with many opportunities. Follow the links for the pilot version of the tool. There is also a video explaining it. The project is co-funded by VINNOVA (Sweden's Innovation Agency), ARQ and participating partners. \r\n",

The town, with its 23,000 inhabitants, has a symbiotic relationship with the mine as its primary economic resource. In 2012, Kiruna municipality invited architects from all over the world to qualify for the architectural competition for the new city center in Kiruna.  The winning team, White Arkitekter and Ghilardi+Hellsten, was then commissioned to author a master plan for Kirunas development for the next 20 years. The proposal, titled ?Kiruna 4-ever?, creates a sustainable vision for the long-term expansion of the city. It is an opportunity for the city to reinvent itself by broadening Kiruna's mix of cultures and diverse population by creating a welcoming and global city within the arctic landscape. The project and process aim for democracy and will be carried out in dialogue with the people of Kiruna. To communicate the new Kiruna visualization and dissemination has been crucial. We have therefore created a 2 min information film (see link nr 3) and graphics explaining the relocation of the city in detail. ",

The ambition is to create a new home for the community of Arverne East; a lively and beautiful environment that interacts, rather than counteracts with the sea and responds to natural forces, similar to how a surfer rides the waves.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate and communicate the proposal a 2 min film was produced, see link.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE COMPETITION AND WINNING PROPOSAL \r\nThe FAR ROC design competition drew submissions from 117 project teams around the world. Our winning proposal aims to transform an 80-acre shoreline site in the Rockaways into a resilient and affordable urban development for the community.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to create an urban design for the community of Arverne East that through a series of small, affordable, and smart interventions creates a model which rises beyond resilient, to a level we call antifragile.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to create an authentic urban development; a new home for the community of Arverne East, a lively and beautiful environment that interacts, rather than counteracts with the sea and responds to natural forces. The community must develop a symbiotic relationship with the environment, similar to how a surfer rides the waves.\r\n\r\nThe design proposes the implementation of a series of interconnected small scale interventions that together disperse and direct wind and flooding in order to bring down the force of nature and direct it away from the proposed mixed use development.\r\n\r\nThe development will be set back from the shore of the built area giving space for a nature reserve. This ecological zone dissipates the ocean?s energy during a storm and forms a new landscape with shallower and calmer water that provides opportunities for leisure and education uses near the new boardwalk.\r\n\r\nThe new boardwalk has a gap on the landside and is elevated where possible to minimize the impact of storm water on the structure. The boardwalk is ?kinked? to disperse storm water.\r\n\r\nTwo large landscaped parks cut through the area, as boulevards do. The parks function both as storm water detainment and retention and as Public Park. Public recreational functions are gathered on the pier, such as a hotel, theater and sport accommodations.\r\n\r\nA new sandbar landscape in the sea is proposed to be organically developed, functioning as a detached breakwater in the sea. The sandbar landscape protects the hinterland during flooding.\r\n\r\nOur urban strategy aims to create an inclusive community that will enable all members to flourish. It respects all citizens and provides opportunities for them to engage in decision-making processes that affect their lives directly.\r\n\r\nThe housing program is inspired by the Scandinavian Model of economic efficiency and welfare state benefits, establishing an appropriate and responsive programme with a healthy mix of housing types supported by commercial and public services and social places.\r\n\r\nWhite Arkitekter?s design proposal Small Means and Great Ends developed in cooperation with Arup and Gensler was announced winner on October 24, 2013, the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy.\r\n",

    "project_description": "Over the course of the last thirty years, more than 7 million Colombians have left their homes and towns in a search for safety. Concentrated in the regions around Medellín, Buenaventura, Sincelejo, and Santa Marta, much of this displacement occurred in the areas where the conflict between the guerrillas of the FARC, the Colombian armed forces, and right-wing paramilitaries was the most intense.\r\n\r\nThis mass migration, with its dense network of specific and often hyper-local causes, forms one part of the much larger global story of human beings on the move, mostly from countryside to city. But this movement of people also underlines the fact that the massive urbanization of the planet is born out of conflict. Who has not heard that by 2050, more than 66% of the world?s population will live in cities? Behind this seemingly inevitable transformation lies battles of all sorts: military, political, social, economic, ethno-religious, imperial, ecological....\r\n\r\nIn Colombia, the armed conflict, if not the movement, might be nearing its end. After more than three years of negotiations between the government and the FARC ? and following a controversial demobilization process by the paramilitaries in 2005 ?Colombian citizens might soon vote on a referendum to approve a historic peace accord between the two parties.\r\n\r\nIn this project we plot the trajectories of these Colombians in conflict, thanks to one dataset: the Registro Unico de Víctimas, a massive project undertaken by the Unidad para la Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas as part of an effort to allocate reparations in the ?peace-building process.? As of May 1, 2016, 8 million Colombians were registered in the database and more than 6.2 million of them were ?subjects of aid and reparation.? The data reflects their stories ? not simply the ones that will lead to aid, but the thick, complicated and often contradictory narratives of an extended and multi-sided conflict, an archive of the memories of millions of people.\r\n\r\nHow has this war affected cities? And how has the conflict played out in the countryside? How have cities ? small, medium and large ? coped with these massive influxes of displaced people? Can spatial analysis ? indeed spatial memory ? figure into discourses of cultural and historical memory? And what relationships can we discover between land use and conflict or the built environment and war?\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies have led data collection efforts designed to inform policy; cultural and civic groups have led extensive efforts to document cultural and historical memory with the intention of furthering transitional justice. Our work is situated between these two realms: it introduces spatial memory into the discourse of transitional justice, and provides insights that might inform nuanced transitional justice policies that are responsive to local needs and cognizant of socio-spatial phenomena.\r\n\r\nOur map shows an overview of the routes of internally displaced people in Colombia from 1985 to 2015. Depending on thickness, each line represents between 50 and 40,000 displaced people. The color white marks origins, while orange rep-\r\nresents destinations. Zooming in and zooming out, we highlight specific events, places, and people that offer interpretations of the conflict, its traces, its memory, its impact, and its future.",

    "project_description": "Taxicabs are ubiquitous in cities throughout the world, and provide critical transit services for residents and travelers. In practice throughout the United States, taxicabs are often regulated locally, where separate municipal licenses are required to pick up passengers in individual cities. This means that for any trips outside of licensed city boundaries taxicabs are forced to make \"deadhead\" trips, where drivers is prohibited from picking up a passenger for a return trip due to license constraints so makes the trip empty. Such license restrictions exist for new smart phone enabled taxi services as well. These deadhead trips result in wasted fuel, congested traffic and diminished taxi services. Yet for these observed effects, there has not been significant scholarly interest in measuring these costs caused by fragmented licensing. This research helps fill this void by analyzing deadhead taxi travel caused by licensing restrictions in the New York City region.\r\n\r\nNew York City recently introduced a special taxi category designed to improve taxi access in previously underserved areas of the city. These Green Taxicabs, as they are called, can drop off passengers anywhere in the city but are restricted from picking up passengers in the central business districts and at any of the region?s airports. This program allows for study of a natural experiment of spatial restrictions on taxicabs through GPS data collected for all Green and Yellow taxi trips in the city. These data are rich with spatial and use characteristics. We analyze all New York City Green and Yellow taxi trips for a one-week period in October 2015 and find that over 20 percent of all Green Taxicab trips result in a deadhead return trip resulting nearly 500,000 km (about 300,000 miles) per week of deadhead travel.",

    "project_description": "Taxicabs are a critical aspect of the public transit system in New York City. Ubiquitous yellow cabs are as iconic as the city?s subway system, and the city recently added green taxicabs to improve taxi service in areas outside of the central business districts and airports. In this paper we use multiple datasets to explore taxicab fare payments by neighborhood and examine how paid taxicab fares are associated with use of conventional banking services. There are clear spatial dimensions of the propensity of riders to pay cash, and we find that both immigrant status and being ?unbanked? are strong predictors of cash transactions. These results have implications for local regulations of the for-hire vehicle industry, particularly in the context of the rapid growth of services that require credit cards. At the very least, existing and new providers of transit services must consider access to mainstream financial products as part of their equity analyses.",

As origins and destinations of Citibike trips are not necessarily symmetrical during the day, Citibike has been forced to constantly move bikes around the city, taking them from full stations and delivering them to empty ones. This problem is both financially expensive and frustrating for Citibike users: many people complain about either not finding bikes at their stations of origin or not finding empty spots when they arrive at their final destinations.\r\n\r\nTo study this problem we have created a series of visualizations which should serve as a starting point for further analysis.",

During the 2 week course of the rainfall, the tool had over 1 million views and collected over 15,000 reports of inundated street segments, and was reported to be widely used by citizen volunteers to research and coordinate post flood relief work. All the data and software source code is made openly available on Github for further improvements and research work.\r\n",

In the process of doing so, not only highlight the vast coverage of the system, but also bring to attention potential areas for expansion, while emphasizing on the skewed form of the country being formed by mass migration to metros.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, there?s been a constant shift of people from villages and smaller towns to major cities. This distress migration to the urban India means a large part of the country is being forgotten & slowly getting disconnected from the rest of us. The project thus reminds one through these rail routes, the connections that still exist and the areas no longer in direct connection with major cities. Focusing on the four metros ? Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata ? the animated visualization reverses this migration by highlighting routes from the metros to the rest of the country. \r\n\r\nThe final form lets the observer make his/her own conclusions about which parts of the country are still not connected directly with the metros, and whether to applaud or critique the extent of the Indian Railway network.",

    "project_year": "2016",
    "project_description": "The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT - see www.pct.bike ) is a new, publicly accessible, open source and online system for sustainable transport planning. The key question that the PCT answers is \"where should new cycle paths be prioritised\". It was funded by the UK's Department for Transport (DfT) and was developed by a group of academics, ensuring that it will be made available for others to use, free of charge, thanks to the AGPL license.\r\n\r\nThe PCT provides an evidence based approach to support planners deciding where to prioritise investment in cycling. Specifically, it helps planners to to prioritise cycling infrastructure notonly where it is easy to build, or where there are an existing large number of cyclists, but to prioritise areas where it is most needed. New cycle paths should be built for tomorrow, not yesterday, so a key feature of the PCT is its provision of scenarios which represent different cycling futures. These are described below for PCT-England, but we plan to create alternative scenarios when the PCT is deployed to new cities and countries around the world.\r\n\r\nThe PCT visualises data at 4 main levels on an interactive web map with different base-maps.  main aim of the PCT is to visualise and explore future demand for cycling. However, it is also a useful tool for exploring the geographical distribution of current cycling patterns. The visualisation levels described below work for every scenario.\r\n\r\n1) At the area level, the PCT shows the percentage of people in each zone who reported cycling as their main mode of travel to work.\r\n\r\n2) 'Desire lines' are straight lines connecting where people live to where they want to travel. The PCT visualises these as straight lines, showing where people would want to travel if they were not constrained by the road network. This is useful for imagining where new cycle paths could be created, regardless of roads.\r\n\r\n3) The route level is the same as the desire line level, but the straight lines are converted to routes. This was was done thanks to CycleStreets.net, a not-for-profit journey planner 'by cyclists, for cyclists'. For each origin-destination pair the PCT can show both the fastest and the quietest routes, as defined by CycleStreets. This distinction can\r\nbe useful for planning new routes. \r\n\r\n4) The route network layer goes a stage further. It is the result of aggregating all\r\noverlapping route-allocated desire lines. The route network layer is crucial for\r\nenvisioning cycling scenarios because it provides an estimate of how many cycle\r\ncommuters could use specific road segments and therefore plan for the appropriate width\r\nand capacity of new infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe scenarios included in the PCT for England were:\r\nScenarios include\r\na) Government Target: this represents a doubling in cycling.\r\nb) Gender Equality: this shows what would happen if women in England as much as men in each area.\r\nc) Go Dutch: this represents what would happen if Dutch propensities to cycle, accounting for hilliness and distance, were achieved.\r\nd) Ebikes: this scenario extends the Go Dutch scenario using data from the Netherlands and Switzerland on how e-bikes help overcome the barriers of distance and hilliness.\r\n\r\nAs open source software using OpenStreetMap data, the PCT has the potential to scale worldwide. We look forward to deploying the PCT in new contexts and showcasing how it can be used by city planners looking to create more sustainable and healthy transport systems.",

He uses his phone as remote to interact with the interface. The audience can later connect their own phone to a multi-player mode. They can see the impact of different heating systems, insulations or water heater on the global network and try to optimize the production of energy.",

By overlaying three-dimensional virtual models with their related elements in the real world, it's possible to browse buildings and other volumetric elements in a seamless experience.\r\n\r\nThe use of geotags in digital assets and the popularization of mobile computing established a new model of information-based interaction.\r\n\r\nMany Location-Based Services (LBS) and Augmented Reality apps treat geo-data as single coordinates to present georeferenced files, to evaluate distances or get relative direction from user. They rely on screen mediation and end up constraining the relation between the user and the environment. It interferes with the interactive experience by adding icons and symbols built upon users field of view, already framed and flattend by the screen.\r\n\r\nAs an outcome of the research, a mobile application was developed that spares the use of displays when selecting points of interest in the physical environment. A tridimensional approach to geo-data (width, depth and height) can recreate the surrounding and reproduce its occlusions and perspective. That way, without the interference of screens or immersive devices, the environment itself is presented as an interface and make technology more subtle in its daily use.",

Tranquil and busy, silent and colourful chaos all at once. Sauntering along its mains and crosses, one soaks in this ?image of the city? as Lynch would call it. Malleshwaram Memoirs is an attempt at visually expressing the rhythmicity of Malleshwaram, an orchestration of selective rhythms constituting its urban fabric one experiences being in it.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford dictionary defines the map as a diagrammatic representation of an area of land or sea showing physical features, cities, roads, a spatial representation. Maps historically have been instruments to represent the topographical terrains and mark the boundaries of a political canvas. Is map merely an instrument for way finding as we more commonly use it today? Can maps become a vehicle for reordering the way we see a place? Rebecca Solnit calls the map a ticket to the actual territory, map as an invitation. The work is an experiment to entice and invite the reader to walk about the streets of Malleshwaram, a hundred year old neighbourhood characteristic of the city of Bangalore. It employs the notion of rhythms (defined by Lefebvre and others) exploring techniques for creating narratives that braid different rhythms in urban spaces; to make visible that sense of ?lived place? we have soaked in but is invisible otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe work metaphorically presents the city place as a musical ensemble, a symphony uniquely shaped by its sense of dwelling. The technique (a work in progress) is promising in offering a visual framework to develop new modes of notation for representing complex urban phenomenon that may in turn be instrumental in informing urban planning decisions to nurture places and not just spaces.",

Not only in the megacities of the global south, life is characterized by a constant struggle with infrastructure. The electricity grid, logistics and supply chains, telecommunication networks ? every system that is centrally planned and managed from above always requires some level of improvisation and tinkering from below in order to make the system work. These creative appropriations are, however, never part of the official representations of infrastructure; they are marginalized and difficult to observe.

The aim of the project is to provide a strategic plan that tackles environmental, spatial and social issues.\r\n\r\nUrban vitality is related to the concentration of people and activities in the city. In order to obtain the degree of urban vitality capable of revealing the areas with positive dynamics, a process of mapping and classification of shops and other commercial spaces had to be carried out. To measure the degree of vitality, commercial establishments were classified based on office hours, attractiveness, size and type of activity. \r\n\r\nThe most prominent areas are those in the city center, which are areas of greatest urban connection. You can see that vitality is associated with the main roads of the city, forming points of urban centrality. By visualizing these areas of higher vitality, it is possible to design strategies to channel and incorporate these vitalities in other areas, in our case, to activate the forgotten areas by the riverbank of the Capibaribe River.

Connectivity to the internet through rich mobile devices, such as the iPhone, enables people to trade goods, services, and ideas faster and more freely than ever. Data from online marketplace eBay shows the universal demand for that technology. Consider this: in the 90 days after the iPhone 6S launch, iPhone 6 captured more than 1% of ?eBay imports? among 10 developing economies - 7 of them in Africa. The device took 4% of imports to Georgia, neighboring Russia. Those national statistics, however, obscure the vivid trade within and between global cities. eBay DataLabs' research scientist Jinrong Xie developed Sales Map to animate how goods - in this case, iPhones - change hands globally from point-to-point. Sales Map - and the linked Vimeo video for Habitat III - shows the connection between eBay buyers and sellers as iPhones are traded on eBay in 2016. Sales Colors represent the condition of the traded good: red signals \"new\" items, yellow signals ?used?, and blue ?refurbished?. Cities emerge organically from patterns in this data. The brightest spots signal vibrant exchanges in advanced technology.",

    "project_description": "This project is the result of a partnership between BBVA Data & Analytics and the United Nations Global Pulse that explores the potential of measuring the economic resilience of people to natural disasters with financial data provided by BBVA Bancomer. The project used the impact of Hurricane Odile on the Mexican state of Baja California Sur ( BCS) in September 2014 to measure how cities and populations prepared for and recovered from the catastrophe. The study analyzed large volumes of anonymized and aggregated financial data from card payments and ATM cash withdrawals to derive proxy indicators of economic activity.\r\nThe team used data visualizations to communicate the results of the investigation (http://odile.bbvadata.com). Some of the findings of the project revealed that, for instance, at household level, people spent 50% more than usual on items such as food and gasoline in preparation for the hurricane. They also showed that the proportional increase in women's expenditure in preparation for the event was double that of men.\r\nIn order to contextualize these metrics, the team also produced an animation, which helps visualize the impact of the hurricane on various regions across Baja California Sur. The visualization replays the disaster with the evolution of the wind speed and people’s economic recovery patterns. The project used NOAA datasets including their Global Forecast System (GFS) and mapped the economic activity at city level.\r\nClimate shocks as floods, earthquakes, or hurricanes, all represent a risk to economic sustainability of human settlements. Findings from this project suggest that insights from transaction data could be used to target emergency response and to estimate economic loss at local level in the wake of a disaster. Such insights could also support business continuity. In addition, it shows that data visualizations are a key element in research work, from the exploration of datasets to extracting patterns in economic behaviour.",

    "project_year": "2016",
    "project_description": "The present design research speculates how a public space intentionally designed to accommodate informality would look. Avoiding the usual solution of popular shopping centers and leasing contracts, temporality is still the solution for low-cost entrepreneurship. Only an open-ended space can allow such appropriations. In order to ensure temporality and avoid privatization, the spaces are subject to variations in sunlight, shade, inundation.\r\nIts design cantilevers over a major road and makes the historical connection between the ocean with the upper city. The initial idea to offer more room in order to unburden the existing informal \"Dawn Market\" was then expanded to other informal users such as food vendors, fishermen, laundresses, fix-it men, street artists, prostitutes. Its proximity to the ocean was integrated into the temporality aspect of this project through the use of the tides to intentionally flood the public square, restarting a new cycle of users, avoiding privatization of public space.\r\nThis is a statement on the importance, permanence and expansion of informal economy. These urban manifestations emerge as a type of bottom-up urban planning. Public policies should not fight informality but enhance it as an attempt to provide social mobilization, giving opportunity to a population which is very unlikely to rise economically.\r\nThis file is a demo version without animations and transitions. The transitions were used during the thesis presentation to support visualization switching between high tide and low tide, different users and day and night, reassuring the rhizomatic and diverse set of programmatic possibilities. It is necessary to download the zipped file, unzip it and run the .exe file, for windows only. I can also export to Mac, if requested.

    "project_year": "2016",
    "project_description": "Brussels, the capital of Belgium is not just home to the European Parliament, but also one of the world?s most multicultural cities. Census data is commonly utilised to create maps that show the distribution of ethnic communities. Yet as large volumes of geotagged data from Twitter become increasingly available, new opportunities arise to study the spatial behaviour of people. \r\n\r\nVisualising geotagged tweets from 2013, we show the geographic distribution of language use in the city. A novel gridded dot mapping technique was utilised to expose several engaging patterns in the data. French is undoubtedly the lingua franca on the street though Brussels serves as the capital to both the French and Flemish communities. Notably, other languages are observed to co-locate with communal institutions, landmarks and even certain municipals. These occurrences are highlighted on the maps. Noteworthy examples include the concentration of Flemish tweets at VUB campuses, the VRT as well as the Flemish and Federal parliaments. English, on the other hand, is most prominent in the vicinity of the European Parliament. Accordingly, the concentration of Turkish tweets within Sint-Joost-ten-Node and Schaarbeek is unsurprising as these municipals are known to house a large migrant Turkish population.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to similar maps depicting populations over large, contiguous blocks of territory, our outcome reveals more intricate spatial patterns that portray the complexity of language communities in Brussels. However, such maps tend to portray a fairly selective representation of the population. Because geotagged Tweets are generated by smartphones, the data only represents a privileged demographic with access to mobile Internet. Furthermore, only a small percentage of tweets are likely to be geotagged. Nonetheless, our results broadly align with existing knowledge of communities in the city and demonstrate the potential of this data for analysis of other human behaviour.",

    "project_year": "2016",
    "project_description": "Every day, more than 6M user trips and 30 percent additional worker movements, shuffle continuously bikes in stations at 950 cities across the world. The vast amounts of data from this complex activity have brought scientists in front of challenging questions, not just about bike sharing, but most importantly, about the future of, more advanced, on-demand mobility systems like autonomous cars. Does sharing decrease cruising vehicles more than it increases parked vehicles? Are human mobility patterns random or predictable? To what extent does form of a city affect its mobility pattern? Are there similarities in behavior between MoD systems in different cities?\r\n\r\nWe analyzed a dataset of 620K trips and 32M station updates from Boston?s bike sharing system during 2012. We discovered that even though trip patterns are random, their net effect on inventory patterns is stable and predictable. Independently of topology, users always move vehicles from residential to commercial areas in the morning, from commercial to residential areas in the evening, and from shortage to surplus areas throughout the day. For workers, it is the other way around. This palindromic tidal movement is consistent across systems, suggesting similarities in movement patterns across cities. Our discovery provides a new perspective in the regularity of complex behavior in on-demand shared systems. \r\n\r\nStudying human movement microscopically through discrete trips is as complex as studying water movement at a molecular level. Here, we study human movement macroscopically through its effect on inventory stock levels. To reconstruct the progress of the system in time, we first calculated local outflows and inflows per station per unit of time from the dataset of trips. Next, we integrated the dynamic trajectory that the system would have if no rebalancing took place by iterating over time and for each time step, for each station, deriving the inventory level by subsequently adding  arrivals and removing departures.\r\n\r\nTo visually reveal the hidden regular macroscopic patterns of commuting, we classified and ordered stations based on how residential, commercial, surplus, or shortage, their activity patterns are. To classify a station we compared the shapes of its departures (outflow) and arrivals (inflow) temporal distributions: The more skewed to the left the departures distribution compared to the arrivals distribution is, the more residential the pattern of the station is. The greater the volume of the inflow distribution compared to the outflow distribution is, the more surplus the pattern of the station is. This provides a common framework to study similarities in the dynamics across seemingly diverse and heterogeneous systems.",

Simply click an interesting spot on Terrapattern's map, and it will find other locations that look similar. Our tool is ideal for locating specialized 'nonbuilding structures' and other forms of soft infrastructure that aren't usually indicated on maps. \r\n\r\nTerrapattern is an open-source, open-access, open-ended project created by a collaborative team of artists, creative technologists, and students. Terrapattern is not a company or startup; it is an experimental research prototype, developed in a university setting, whose purpose is to present a new way of exploring, understanding, and organizing the world.

    "project_description": "This Final Thesis is the result of two parallel processes: one is a contextual-physical approach and the other is a programmatic-abstract concept. Both merge to create a project that intends to reallocate and reorganise a vast area surrounding the existent Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. A systematic program is superimposed to the previous reality and it generates a new but inherent project that consists of two main levels: a ground floor for a Transportation Interchange Station beneath a complex rooftop that allocates a Social Centre for reintegrating people in danger of social exclusion. All the project has been designed with a pattern-system based on territorial planning or geology maps which merges floor plans and transversal sections in one same document.\r\n\r\nThe whole complex works like a city itself. All the services are provided by people attending the reintegration program who work controlled by a vigilance system and can only interact with customers in certain areas. This project makes only sense if you understand that Downtown Los Angeles has the highest crime ratio in the city and allocates almost 10.000 homeless every year. On top of that, it also has one of the biggest prison facilities in the world with almost 7.000 inmates. Hollywood has been designed as a set decoration where everything can be televised. This voyeurism is a form of \"panoptic\" control which can be used as a form of reinsertion into society.",

It will be an analysis and decision-support tool for collaboration and resilience decision-making. The resilience.io platform combines computer representations of resource flows, human and business activities and infrastructure systems. The platform contains a growing library of process models of typical human, industrial and ecological systems, the relevant ones of which are used in a local instance to create a tailored integrated systems model for a city-region.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to connect to many data sources, including from earth observation satellites, government and private sector data, local sensor networks, smart phones, tablets and local survey data. This data is processed by the systems model and visualized to give an improved understanding of the human, economic and ecological systems within a region including how these are interlinked.\r\n\r\nInstalling a local version of the model allows communities to manage both their economy and its critical supporting ecosystems on the basis of integrated systems insights. It allows city-regions globally to assess their current development path, taking account of the risks of climate change, resource scarcity and events and map out a more sustainable and resilient pathway. It is a tool for testing possible scenarios and driving towards a holistic set of social, environment and economic goals.\r\n\r\nresilience.io is designed and created to support regional investment and performance based procurement in resilient growth of sustainable city-regions with the governance and metrics that planners, designers and investors need. Utilities, services and transport infrastructure, construction, water and energy supply, clean technology, climate adaptation, agriculture and forestry, health and education are all part of this and together are vital components of resilient urban growth. The platform will build evidence to attract public and private investment to climate adaptation and mitigation projects that achieve economic, social and environmental goals within resilient inclusive development.\r\n",

    "project_description": "The World Urban Database and Access Port Tools (WUDAPT) initiative (www.wudapt.org) is a community driven data collection initiative that draws upon the considerable network of urban climate scientists around the world. The ultimate goal of the WUDAPT project is to develop a detailed, open access, urban database for all major cities in the world, which will be useful for many applications including planning for climate resilience, energy modeling, greenhouse gas assessment, etc. At its core, WUDAPT describes the physical geography of cities by capturing information on urban form (e.g. building density) and function (e.g. energy demand) at a suitable scale for urban climate studies and modelling. The basic structure of cities is captured using the Local Climate Zones (LCZs) scheme, which categorizes natural and urban landscapes into distinctive types, each of which is recognizable from aerial and satellite imagery. Each LCZ is associated with a unique combination of urban parameter values that capture aspects of urban form and function regulating the micro-climate.\r\n\r\nChina is the biggest developing country in the world. Recent fast urbanization has changed her natural landscape and brought extra burdens on her environment. Sustainable urban development is urgently needed. Given the lack of land cover information, and urban morphology data availability, quality and harmonization in China, by adopting the WUDAPT product and data, researchers, climatologists, and modellers can conduct quantitative evaluations and research on the impact of urban development on the local environment. Then, based on that, local planners and policy makers can formulate better evidence-based solutions and obtain spatial information for sustainable development. The research team from the Institute of Future Cities of The Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed the local climate zone mapping work and WUDAPT level 0 products for 58 cities and regions in China. They have also developed an innovative advanced technology and method to detect 3-demonsion information about urban morphology for developing WUDAPT level 1 & 2 products. Several on-going international collaborations are exploring various applications of WUDAPT data in different aspects of sustainable urban development in China, for example, Eco-city's performance evaluation and planning for Jing-Jin-Ji region, Haze/dust events in the Yellow River Delta Region, Urban Heat Island and Extreme Heat events in the Pearl River Delta Region. \r\n",

In front of the wall, a light shaft extends to the surface of the plaza where a video camera is set up. The camera continuously films passing pedestrians on the plaza and streams the feed to a specially developed generative software application (coded by Felix Bonowski) which derives proposed geometries for structures based on the movement patterns of the pedestrians. These interpretations of the real-time video generate new geometries for the location and propose axes and parcels. Two elevators, to the left and right of the large video image, lead from the plaza to the rail platform. On the platform, the geometric structures can be heard as a sound interpretation (by Yunchul Kim). At the centre of the artistic intervention is the video image and its artistic concept. \r\nThe software is implemented to execute the following program: \r\n1. Select a location (origin)\r\n2. Determine the movement axes of people and traffic\r\n3. Look to see if these axes are at angles to one another, which when mirrored and rotated can form a polygon, the sides of which all extend outward equally\r\n4. Draw this polygon to approximate the natural geometry of the location\r\n5. Look to see if, starting from this, the intrinsic geometries of the location can form a surface structure, (tessellation) that periodically repeats the original geometries\r\n6. Determine whether and how, in the aerial image of the location, the areas fit together in the revealed geometry of  the place\r\n7. Enhance existing structures by developing their geometries\r\n8.

The tool is the outcome of research on urban water management cases across US, from East to West Coast. It is a data-driven framework designed to be tailored to varying water system challenges: from stormwater management in New England, to water shortage as in California.\r\nThe tool consists of two distinct parts: the first can be summarized as \"learn the system\" and the second as \"improve the system\". The scope of the first part is to develop awareness about the water system for non-expert stakeholders, such as city managers and the community. Through data visualization and system-based storytelling, it provides information about the urban water flows, performance data, and geospatial synergies.\r\nThe second part - through interactive modeling and scenario evaluation - highlights the opportunities to improve the system. Our algorithm identifies the buildings, streets, and parking areas for potential green infrastructure or water-harvesting interventions, and quantifies their impact to the reduction of runoff and imported water. The opportunities (green roofs, street planters, porous pavement) focus on the needs of the City of Chelsea MA, our first prototype. ",

    "project_description": "Among the important highlights of ongoing research conducted at the Science and Technology in Archaeology Research Centre (STARC, Cyprus Institute) is the cross-disciplinary study of the layered built heritage of historic cities in Cyprus and the broader Eastern Mediterranean basin. Focusing primarily on the city of Nicosia, Virtual Environments Cluster and the research group on Cultural Landscapes and Built Heritage address an array of themes and phenomena drawing from region?s rich heritage while utilizing STARC?s cutting edge technological and analytical infrastructure. Research work in Nicosia is possible in close collaboration with the Cyprus Department of Antiquities and the collaborative activities with the Nicosia Master Plan in Nicosia.\r\nResearch in Nicosia is pursued with the direct engagement of the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications in the framework of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  ? CyI collaboration. This opportunity has fostered the effective utilization of advanced visualization in the study of historic environments. In particular, the use of immersive virtual environments in cultural heritage and the systematic analysis of built heritage has been the focus of the ongoing study of the historic core of Nicosia which invests in the application of 3D documentation, visualization and virtual environments for the study of layered historic cities in the Eastern Mediterranean. \r\nThe success of our work has produced notable results: \r\n1) The preservation and post-excavation management of the archaeological site of the Paphos Gate, Nicosia, implemented by Cyprus Department of Antiquities and the Municipality of Nicosia, has been based on our proposal and design made possible in the context of our research work;\r\n2) The introduction of broader collaborative approaches focusing on the study of ?Mediterranean Cities in Transition? - a research project pursued in collaboration with UIUC and grants and fellowships at the American Academy in Rome and the Getty Research Institute;\r\n3) Collaboration with the Municipality of Nicosia for the creation of a 3D interactive platform of the Greek-Cypriot part of Nicosia for the promotion and presentation of newly developed areas of the city along with important planned urban regeneration projects (2015). Visualizing the entire city in 3D and enabling, through the use of advanced computational models, the integration of data overlays is potentially the key to unlocking how we tackle development and infrastructure planning decisions in the future; and, \r\n4) Our work is already at the core of a series of academic grant and EU research proposal applications on the study of Historic Cities in the Mediterranean.\r\n",

But my first insight came around in August 2013, in the streets of Kiev, Ukraine: during that personal trip, I recorded a short video of a musician and posted it on my personal Instagram profile. He was playing a string instrument I had never seen called bandura. I was going to take a picture, but Instagram had just released its 15-seconds video format. I made the recording and realized that 15 seconds was an interesting length for a narrative.\r\n\r\nAfter that trip, I moved to São Paulo for professional reasons (I was living in Porto Alegre before), where I began to record street musicians that I encountered on the way home. I spent a lot of time at the Consolação subway station, where several buskers play. I started recording and putting the music videos on my personal Instagram account. Then I created a series, with the hashtag #streetmicrodocs. A great friend of mine, called Max Laux, gave me a single and important tip: ?Why don?t you turn this street music series of yours into an Instagram account??. Months later, during a free consultation from the Brazilian Startups' Association (ABStartups), I changed the name of the project to StreetMusicMap. Later, Instagram increased the video length to 1 minute, which was very important for the project.  \r\n\r\nIn the last 4 years, StreetMusicMap became a multimedia project: a collaborative listing of street music performers from all over the world. It has more than 1,350 artists documented on videos in 97 countries, filmed by more than 700 collaborators, and up to 41,000 followers on Instagram. StreetMusicMap Instagram won Silver at the 2017 W³ Awards (Content & Marketing-Social Video for Social category) and it is a two-time Webby Award Nominee (Social???Music category in 2017 and 2018), chosen by the International Academy of Digital Arts & Sciences as the top 5 in its category in the world.\r\n\r\nThe StreetMusicMap itself is being developed to share full info about the artists. A live album with street bands from São Paulo, Brazil, was released in 2016: StreetMusicMap Vol. 1 - Live at O.bra Festival (Loop Discos). StreetMusicMap Radio is the new podcast launched in 2017. It is also the first project to curate street musicians on Spotify, creating global playlists featuring the best buskers in the world. The research has been shared by important media companies, such as BBC, The Guardian, CityLab, HuffPost, Atlas Obscura, AdWeek, WFMU Radio, Instagram (Music Department), and universities: University of Texas at Austin (Journalism in the Americas), CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, University of Toronto, The New School, Newcastle University (UK) and Monash University (Melbourne, Australia).\r\n\r\nB.B. King, Édith Piaf, Eric Clapton, Jay-Z: all these big names started out on the street, where there are a lot of good people doing it, but we rush so much these days that we do not even pay attention to the things around us. I consider myself a reporter no matter the name of my job, because I always try to tell a story, when I?m producing, writing or recording.\r\n\r\nI always try to give credit to the artist and to the person who made the recording. In the beginning, I was a purist and did not post without the musician?s name. But over time, I realized that the platform became a channel for promotion, because many anonymous artists were being identified in the comments. This was the case of a video of a Russian harpist playing in Red Square in Moscow. The recording was posted without her name, and minutes later, the artist identified herself in the comments: ?:D wow! It?s me!?\r\n\r\nIn another case, a social worker in the Democratic Republic of Congo sent a message to me thanking for the sequence of videos published with African musicians. She said she was able to explain to deaf-mute students the different cultures of the African continent just with the musicians? body language.\r\n\r\nFor Instagram, the charm is that the video gives you the sensation of traveling the world. That?s why I like raw videos with little production. There?s the dog barking, the car passing, and the immediate audience reaction. That sound of the street is the differential, you feel like a witness.\r\n\r\nSHORT BIO:\r\n\r\nDaniel Bacchieri is a journalist, film director, multimedia producer and music curator.

Contrary to the common belief ? propagated by local media - that Chinese people are ?invading? the city, the project helped reveal that, while we have and are witnessing a small-scale migration of Chinese people to Bolzano, they are not creating a ghetto in the city. Rather, they are integrating within it. This project, is the result of a web based long-term journalistic enquiry. It features animated and interactive infographics, maps, and a series of qualitative interviews, which help reshape the identity of the local Chinese community through digital media, in order to contrast with the dominant and misleading narrative by the local media. Through a design project based on more transparent and balanced information, thereby allowing a broader audience to inform itself on such a complex and multifaceted issue, the project opened a local debate about the integration of the Chinese people in the city, that led the local media purveyor of the ?invasion? theory to reverse its narrative.   \r\n\r\nPeople?s Republic of Bolzano has awarded with the Data Journalism Award 2015 (best data visualisation of the year, small newsroom) and the European Design Award 2016 (Bronze, digital infographics).\r\n\r\nYou can read the whole publication below (extract from the book ?Data journalism: inside the global future isbn 1845496639) \r\nhttps://www.academia.edu/19634633/Reporting_the_invasion_perception_and_reality_of_Chinese_migrants_in_Bolzano_Italy\r\nhttps://medium.com/@matteo.moretti/visual-journalism-and-dominant-narratives-e7bd7ff7728d\r\n\r\nGerman & Italian version > http://www.repubblicapopolaredibolzano.it/\r\nenglish version > http://www.peoplesrepublicofbolzano.com/\r\n\r\n",

    "project_description": "We propose that Participatory Data Physicalizations (PDP) can be a way to promote participation, democratize data beyond the simple diffusion of information and deepen citizens? understandings of complex everyday life. Relying on those reflection, the research team designed a PDP in the frame of the TED MED event, held at the Politecnico di Milano on November 3 2017. The project aimed to inform a heterogeneous audience on the quantitative data connected to the cancer in Italy and the related prevention best practices, through senses other than view, and a playful approach.  One of the aims of the installation was to expose participants to their lack of knowledge, asking them to guess on cancer-related numbers, so making them aware of their ignorance on the topic, through a playful approach.  \r\nThe evaluation and the data collected revealed that people underestimate the cancer: despite they know its dangerousness they think it can be avoided mainly following the prevention best practices. Moreover, the evaluation confirmed that the project successfully exposed participant to their information gap on cancer data, arousing curiosity on the right information, that were then provided through an informative booklet distributed after the completion. Compared to a digital form online survey where usually a discrete percentage drop some questions or answer randomly, all the participants completed and answered to all the questions, probably due to the physical and participatory approach that engaged participants and let them feeling ?on the stage?, so protagonists of a particular experience, pushing them to a serious and intense participation.\r\n",

Apart from packing parking spaces and rolling up street, bicycle path, and rail spaces for 23 cities worldwide, What the Street!? introduces the mobility triangle for comparing modal shares with available mobility spaces, confirming visually the arrogance of space, i.e. the allocation of a privileged amount of urban space to cars at the expense of sustainable mobility like cycling.",

    "project_description": "Streets and squares are an archive of both language and history. We suspected that their names would reveal patterns, and we wanted to make them visible. Doing such a thing is impossible using conventional map tools because none of them will show you all of the streets and squares of the same name at the same time.\r\nThat is why ZEIT ONLINE programmed a searchable database including all German streets and squares. By doing so, we discovered some fascinating patterns in the distribution of the 450,000 street names. They tell the story of almost forgotten artists and historical events, they shed light on obsolete economic structures and trade routes, on dialects and on idioms imported from abroad. Additionally, we identified groups of streets with thematically linked terms like the names of poets or types of animals. Beyond that, for example, we searched for all the possible endings to a street name, like Limes Road, Limes Way, Limes Alley or Limes Lane for discernible name components like -limes. All streets with the same root name were then tested to see if there were linked groups of streets on a local level. This enabled us to uncover other patterns. ",
    "project_partner": "The foundation of our tool is OpenStreetMap, a map wiki where volunteers collect information on all streets around the world.\r\nUsing the Overpass_API via http://overpass-turbo.eu/ we could see first pattern, i.e. that  streetnames with (Paul von) Hindenburg are only left in Germanys western parts. Using that information, the Karlsruhe-based service provider Geofabrik created a dataset for us including all streets and squares in Germany (current as of Oct. 10, 2017). It includes the respective street names, the postal codes and communities through which the streets lead, and the precise geometry of the route taken by the street. Geofabrik also combined multiple data points from OpenStreetMap to create a single, coherent data object accurately reflecting the street's geometry.\r\nYou can download the data here in GeoJSON format: http://interactive.zeit.de/2017/strassennamen/datensatz_deutsche_strassennamen.zip",

The process of filming became and integrated part of the design process. \r\n\r\nThe films that Media HQ has produced had 3 very clear objectives; \r\n1- to document the design process for future funding of the Urban Labs project \r\n2- to create a document that local architects and authorities can use to convince funding parties to join. \r\n3- to give a interactive boost to the design process.\r\n\r\nthe films did have that desired spin off; many of he projects are now well under way to get the right financial support.\r\never better: the film have been watched over 100.000 through the Vimeo and YouTube channels and Media HQ has been invited to make more films for UN Habitat to document processes in a similar way. Other UN agencies are now using the same flim techniques too.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly;  local TV stations in the countries/cities where it has been filmed have aired the short films, both for creating leverage with the bigger audience for the upcoming changes in the cities, and for general public information too.",

The height signifies the amount of trees, whereas the wood represents the most prevalent tree. The map is based on a laser-cut base that features additional information about each neighborhood like exact number of trees and a chart about the different species. \r\n\r\nThe sculpture is interactive: by picking up blocks the audience can experience the haptic qualities of the wood. Beneath the blocks is a printed map that shows the exact geo-location of each tree. \r\n\r\nThis project was created in the context of NYC open data week and the DataThroughDesign exhibition. ",

    "project_description": "Mobility data, data analysis, big data ? these terms are all rather abstract. With ?So bewegt sich Deutschland? (How Germany moves), Telefónica NEXT has created an interactive map using anonymized mobile data to visualize nationwide traffic flows. The aim is to introduce and highlight the benefits of a new data class for sustainable mobility and transport planning in Germany. \r\n\r\nIt provides regional insights on topics such as commuter behaviour and morning departure times for Hamburg, Berlin and Munich. The information is highly relevant for cities, transport companies and service providers because the data show origin-destination-relations for all transport modes and. Thereby, the data help mobility providers to create and improve services based on real customer needs.\r\n\r\nUsers can interact with the map on the website by zooming in on regions of their choice, assessing the two integrated deep dives for a \"Day in Germany\", e.g. by clicking on Berlin, or by viewing the carnival deep dive by clicking on Cologne. They can also enter a German ZIP-code and get a shareable graphic of inbound and outbound traffic in the area over the day, including the average morning peak time.\r\n\r\nIn Telefónica Germany?s normal operations, mobile network data are generated by over 45 million mobile lines. This happens as mobile phones communicate with cells when surfing the internet or making calls. Telefónica Deutschland anonymizes the around five billion data points per day using a three-level TÜV-certified process so that they cannot be assigned to individuals.\r\n\r\nThe launch of the dataviz website in January 2018 received significant media attention. The project was recognized with a German Online Communications Award in Gold in the Transport & Logistics category.\r\n",

The Citizen Dialogue Kit is intended to ease the creation of impactful public displays for visualizations of urban data through a content ideation method, custom open source software and casing designs for off the shelf hardware components. Too often potentially impactful urban data ends up on online platforms and struggles to reach local actors. This project, inspired by citizen science and open data initiatives, is an attempt to bring this data back into its original context where it potentially has the most relevancy: the city streets. Polling buttons integrated into the displays draw in passers-by, encourage them to reflect on the presented data and facilitate contributing opinions to become part of the dialog.\r\nThe system uses e-ink displays, 3G-connected microcontrollers and large power banks to enable easy and flexible deployments around the city. \r\nOur continuing research investigates how our methodology can empower people to compose engaging narratives using data and multiple contextually situated displays, and how passers-by and neighborhood inhabitants interpret and experience these narratives. Preliminary deployments in collaboration with a bottom-up citizen science project indicate the potential of the concept. Longer future deployments and collaborations are already planned, e.g. about housing. \r\n",

We sought to deliver it in a user-friendly way, rather than in a hard-core academic tone, so to make it more inclusive: for a wide range of people generated the data that we show here - and we owe them. \r\n\r\nWe have pursued a certain depth of analysis that goes beyond the pure mapping: We have sought interpretation through visual and quantitative means, we have identified recognisable clusters of users and shown how they experience Madrid quite differently, drawn by different interests. We have tried to shed some light on the intricate matter that makes up this polis, in what we like to call an exercise of modern anthropology. By unveiling hundreds of thousands of traces, we might arrive at clues that, if framed within the complexities that make up a city, could yield a draft of how we interface with our environment. \r\n\r\nWe hope you find this exercise compelling.\r\nYou can read further about our motivation and methodology in our #about page:\r\n\r\nhttps://madrides.in/about.html\r\n",

The OMG! installation / tutorial is an example of the ?Play to Plan? philosophy, which uses gaming mechanics as a magnifying glass to observe the city and understand its inner logic. \r\n\r\nThe OMG! is loosely based on the premises of the New Environmental Law (in Dutch: Omgevingswet, playfully shortened to OMG!) and the possibilities this Law enables to the increase of the civic participation in the built environment planning. The installation uses digital application to track and display stakeholders / players actions, making it possible to shape, cut, demolish and re-build the simulated models of the real-life locations and analyse the results. The simple, but symbolically rich visual language of the installation combines graphic design, a bit of computer coding, and some basic architectural model-making turned industrial / game design.  \r\n",

    "project_description": "The Chronoscope Hamburg is a time machine to explore the historical topology and development of the city of Hamburg. It offers 9 vintage maps in a geo web application ? spanning the time frame from 1590 until 1937. It was necessary to align the maps to display them with high precision on top of today?s map or satellite view. The web app provides controls to zoom into the details on street and fleet level, and to compare the maps across centuries. Most prominent is the fortification of Hamburg that protected the city against the Danish neighbors in the 17th century. Later the city merged with the former Danish city of Altona. By end of the 19th century a large storage house district was built in the harbor. The so-called »Speicherstadt« and »Kontorhausviertel« are a world heritage sites of UNESCO.\r\n\r\nIt is a deliberate design decision that the Chronoscope works as a personal research medium. There are neither guided tours nor info boxes that distract the user from her own personal journey through space and time. It is one of Chronoscope?s key strength to support a self-paced discovery of streets and locations that resonate with the user?s curiosity and her own urban experiences. Furthermore it is possible to store and share locations and years with persistent »ChronoLinks«. They can be used to point a friend to a specific detail and discuss the findings together.\r\n\r\nThe maps are enhanced by two info layers. The time frame of late 1600 shows the home of about 60 Hamburg residents. They have been discovered and identified in the transcribed version of more than 10.000 pages of the High Court of Admiralty in London of the 1650s. The merchants and sailors are known by name and street address. The other info layer shows spacial info on about 75 buildings of the 1920s, mostly schools but also hospitals and ?once again? the office district Kontorhausviertel. More than 1,300 vintage architecture photographs by the brothers Dransfeld can be accessed through the interface of Chronoscope Hamburg.\r\n\r\nThe ChronoLinks are also key to utilize the Chronoscope as a plugin in other web applications. For instance, Georg Koppman got the task to document the Brook habor district before it was demolished in 1883 and the following years to build the Speichstadt. Each photo together with a ChronoLink provides the impression where it was taken and how the area was looking 135 years earlier.\r\n\r\nThroughout the concept and development process usability and interaction design have been a major objective. Each interactive element went through several iterations, and it was evaluated if it provides sufficient value and delight to the user. The qualities are: (i) high precision, (ii) high performance, (iii) robustness, (iv) clean layout and user interface, (v) responsive design, (vi) keyboard shortcuts, and (vii) contextual and innovative gesture controls.\r\n\r\nChronoscope Hamburg is a mapbox application that displays vintage maps provided under CC-BY-4.0 by the State and University Library Hamburg Carl von Ossietzky.\r\n",

Urban areas get increasing emphasis, especially in the context of future Car2X-communication. The project's goal was to model such virtual three-dimensional (3D) environments and logical road descriptions automatically based on a tool chain from heterogeneous geographic datasets (e.g., cadastral data, road surveying, aerial pictures, and crowd-sourced data). As proof of concept, the urban area of Braunschweig, Germany, was chosen.\r\n\r\nThe generated 3D city model outperforms similar city models in terms of details, especially regarding the completeness of the road model with all relevant traffic infrastructure elements. Our current and future research focusses on transferring this approach to other geographic locations and to use such detailed city models for development of smart city applications, urban planning and emission simulation in combination with virtual and augmented reality technologies.",

In this book, the ?science of making cities? became a new discipline with a broad economic, social and cultural impact on the lives of people in the city. On the 150th anniversary of its publication, the first translation into English has been published with the aim of expanding knowledge of Ildefons Cerdà?s work\r\nand fostering the debate about the process of future urbanization.\r\n\r\nThe book has two volumes. The first one sets the basis of the Theory and the second contains an exhaustive statistical description of the city of Barcelona in 1867, that has been transformed into interactive graphics and an open data platform of the Big Data of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe platform has three main sections. The first one is an interactive data visualisation of more than 700 pages and 100 tables that have been previously digitised and translated into machine-readable format. The main menu works as a general index giving an overview of the global content structure and enabling access to each chapter or individual statistics. The information has\r\nbeen visualised according to different data types -bar charts, line charts, pie charts and maps all of them with different level of aggregation-, providing a context and a description to each table (putting together several data that was unstructured in the original book).\r\n\r\nThe second part consists of a 3-D modelling of urban indicators (number of inhabitants, number of buildings per type, mortality rate, among others) that enables to compare Barcelona during 1867 with the current city. The original book includes several tables that present aggregated data at the level of a city block. It has been necessary to digitise ancient cartography of the central\r\ndistrict of Barcelona to match this information and give a spatial component to the data.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the project has a strong commitment to openness, the third section of the platform conatins a complete series of data sets published under open standards. An internal visualization tool enables the users to make and share their own graphics.\r\n\r\nThe project emphasizes the role of urbanism as a science as Cerdà conceived it. It makes his theoretical work accessible for all through data visualization and puts Cerdà?s digitized legacy in the hands of the scientific community to promote knowledge of his work and urbanism in general.",

Using open data on traffic incidents from the Washington DC's District Department of Transportation (DDOT), combined with anonymous sensor data, we?ve visualized traffic fatalities in the last few years, and identified the highest risk areas to focus interventions.\r\n\r\nWe began by examining the distribution of crashes in 3D, aggregated to census tracts and census blocks. For example, at the block level, you can see that Union Station stands out as one particular hot spot of crash incidents. You can further zoom in to see individual accidents, visualized as circles that vary in size and color to reflect the severity of each accident.\r\n\r\nTo identify high risk areas for crashes in DC, we built a collision frequency model that compares several open datasets and sensor data. We looked at the number of incidents normalized by the volume of vehicles and pedestrians and analyzed how incidents correlate to the density of businesses, schools, intersections, employment, census data, and driving speeds.",

    "project_description": "\"Civar is a map for event exploration, based on real user needs. Citizens have different preferences when it comes to going out. We sometimes look for a live and crowded party on a Friday night, or a small meetup about science-fiction literature, around where we live. These decisions are also affected by the traffic jam, people density in the area or how the weather is that day.  \r\n\r\nWe started this project by collecting user needs, not data. Our participants from diverse backgrounds had a wide range of criteria for choosing an event. Overall, they wanted to know what, when and where the event is. However, they also wanted to know how loud or active it is, how much it costs, how many people are attending, how big is the venue, what language the event is. Civar visualizes these different dimensions of event data to fulfill diverse user needs about discovering events. We designed a circle glyph that gradually becomes more detailed, to visualize more dimensions of event data without overwhelming the user. At the city level, color coding indicates the type of event and the scale of the circle shows how many users are attending the event. At the district level, a second nested circle means how much room left at the event. At street level, the straight circle indicates if the event is loud and a zig-zagged circle indicates if the event is physically active. These visualized dimensions enable exploration at different levels of detail. After we got initial feedback from the users on our design, we started collecting data from publicly available sources and social media. We are constantly working to find more accurate, diverse and open data sources for Civar.\r\n\r\nIn addition to event discovery, real-time data layers (traffic, people density, and weather) enable creating rich insights about the city. These insights can be useful for researchers and decision makers to get a deeper understanding of how the city lives. Overall, Civar aims to reflect the city in its intricate, living existence in an explorable way. \r\n\r\nThis project is a part of a Ph.D. research project that focuses on the question ?How could we visualize geographical data to support everyday decision making about events??

Glyphs show the amount of boarding and deboarding passengers for each stop at a specific time. 2) Two line chart show boarding and deboarding passengers per hour at a selected station for both directions. Thus, the temporal characteristics of this station can be easily seen with e.g. commuting patterns emerging. 3) A heatmap calendar visualizes passenger volume, and helps to understand general temporal patterns, such as working day behaviour.\r\nAll views are interactive and connected. Analysts can select a specific day in the calendar which updates the Marey chart, then choose a station to investigate which highlights that station in the main view as well as in the dual line chart.\r\n\r\nPAXmotion is an interdisciplinary research project developed by computer science and design students of the Mannheim  University of Applied Sciences, in cooperation with the Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr GmbH, a public transport company.",

    "project_year": "2017",
    "project_description": "?Mapping Yusuf?s Universe? is a digital mapping project of the elite networks in late Ottoman Pera, the ?European,? and ?cosmopolitan? district of Istanbul, connecting spatial and network layers that bring to fore the relations of power that constituted the elite social world of late nineteenth century Ottoman cosmopolitanism.\r\n\r\nMapping Yusuf?s Universe is part of tripartite research project, The Characters of Yusuf Franko: An Ottoman Bureaucrat?s Caricatures, composed of a physical exhibition organized at Koç University?s Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations, a scholarly book and an online exhibition.\r\n\r\nThis project takes an unpublished caricature album from this period as its vantage point: Yusuf Franko Kusa (1853 ? 1933), a venerated Ottoman bureaucrat, had left a secret, unpublished manuscript album, titled Types et Charges, in which he collected 120 caricatures, dated from 1884 to 1896, of the members of his own social world ? imperial bureaucrats, European diplomats, the wealthy members of the elite society, the mesdames and the monsieurs, the beys and the efendis. Using these caricaturized portraits of these ?types? of the period as a gateway to this world, this project maps the way in which elite social networks were founded through material links in the urban space, and represented in Yusuf Franko?s caricatures.  \r\n\r\nThe base map of the visualization is the index plate Charles E. Goad?s 1905 cadastral map of Istanbul?s Pera district (https://www.archives.saltresearch.org/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=458311&silo_library=GEN01). The digital visualization is inspired by the namesake section at the physical exhibition. For this section, the base map was painted on a wall within the ANAMED Gallery (please see the photographs uploaded in the media section of the application form). It was surrounded by the thumbnails of the characters of Yusuf Franko, which were matched with specific places on the map according to residential or occupational links, represented by strings of various colors. These characters were interconnected as well through kinship, friendship, business, and patronage links. The visitors are presented a legend of the colours so that they are invited to read a multi-layered map in the venue. There was also a hard-copy textual legend in the gallery in which the characters are introduced in detail. \r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of this mapping, a lot of historical data unearthed during the research was omitted for the physical display in order to make it more accessible for the visitor of the gallery, who would spend very limited time in front of this particular section of the exhibition. This limitation of the physical display gave birth to the idea of having a much more detailed and accessible digital version that would also create a more permanent record and database for future research.\r\n\r\nWorking together with Kakare Interactive, the map was moved to the digital platform, where visitors could explore in detail how the members of Pera's elite advanced their power through the connections they developed and the urban spaces they invested in. This digital version allowed us to include a greater number of interpersonal and spatial connections. Thanks to the interface prepared for this digital platform, two important features could also be added to the mapping. First, rather than being limited to the index plate, the interface integrates the index plate with the actual plates, displayed to the user as they zoom in or out. This allows a much more accurate and detailed demonstration of the spatial relations of Pera's elites. Second, all characters are featured with their short biographical information, giving a richer experience to the visitor, and creating an archive that would be available for other researchers. \r\nAll in all, this permanent website hosted by the Koç University helps urban researchers learn from the past and understand the present-day cosmopolitan Pera district of Istanbul.  \r\n\r\nWho is Yusuf Franko? What is so special about him?\r\nYusuf Franko Kusa was a late 19th-century Ottoman bureaucrat, a Minister of Foreign Affairs, a governor general, and a man of society, as well as an avid caricaturist. The exhibition and hence the website revolves around Yusuf Franko Kusa Bey?s unique caricature album. Yusuf Franko?s album, compiled between the years 1884 and 1896, was on display for the first time at the exhibitions. The visitors met satirically charged portraits of wealthy capitalists, members of high society, Ottoman pashas, Levantines, artists, and diplomats of the late 19th century. The caricatures offer the visitors the opportunity to take note of the colorful social networks to which Yusuf Franko belonged, especially those of the Beyo?lu-Pera quarter, as well as the global locales of Istanbul. By following the caricatures, their real-life counterparts, and the places they frequented, the exhibition and its digital version emphasize how the Galata-Beyo?lu axis became a financial and diplomatic center as well as a destination of international culture and arts. They also touch on significant places of the period, such as the Naum Theater. In part, the exhibition also serves as a reminder of those locales, which no longer exist and did not find their way onto the album.\r\n",

Did it have a history of flooding? Who lived there? Has the town recovered, or been transformed in some fundamental way? Which lots were most affected? And what differences were there in the impact on different lots by factors such as location and assessed value?\r\n\r\nThis project delves into these questions as it explores the story of Oakwood, a neighborhood plagued with flooding and planning problems for decades. For the survivors of Sandy, it is a success story where the state finally stepped in with a buyout and wetlands reseeding plan that the majority of residents were thrilled to receive, though it left some steadfast owners isolated in a transformed landscape. This website reveals when and which homes were demolished, and offers many interactive features that reveal hidden patterns in Oakwood's profound transformation.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to make visible the overlapping government buyout programs concentrated in the Staten Island neighborhood of Oakwood Beach in the years after Hurricane Sandy. The ownership of each lot within the neighborhood (represented as a horizontal bar in the visualization), as well as lots status as vacant, is depicted. This visualization was designed to highlight the isolated homes still existing amongst the newly vacant lots that comprise most of the neighborhood.",

Prof. Nina Ergin, Assoc. Prof. Sertaç Kak? and Assoc. Prof. As?m Evren Yantaç, is developed by Hüseyin Ku?cu.\r\n\r\nThe Soundscape of Istanbul project (https://soundscapeofistanbul.ku.edu.tr) approaches everyday traditions and daily urban life from a sonic perspective and aims to increase public awareness of cultural sounds. Sounds are inevitable parts of our daily lives and our cultures. Also, sounds are of great importance in terms of intangible cultural heritage. Sounds that are not protected or archived get lost forever. In a dynamic city such as Istanbul, daily life and urban sounds change rapidly. Therefore, it is significant and necessary to protect cultural soundmarks of the city to sustain cultural identity and cultural memory.\r\n\r\nIn The Soundscape of Istanbul project, sound symbols of Istanbul were determined according to an online survey and interviews that we conducted. These characteristic urban sounds were recorded with professional equipment throughout the year 2015. The collection of ?The Soundscape of Istanbul? is publicly accessible at Koç University Suna K?raç Library (http://digitalcollections.library.ku.edu.tr/cdm/landingpage/collection/SOI).\r\n\r\nSoundsslike project is initiated in order to expand this sound collection. In this project, an interactive platform was developed in which anyone can record and upload sounds. The main aim of the project is to raise public awareness of urban and cultural sounds and to protect these sounds as a collective work. The project is initiated with the city of Istanbul and now there are urban sounds from over 15 cities including London, Paris and Le Havre. \r\n\r\nThe project became associate partners with Europeana Sounds and the collection can also be accessible under Europeana Sounds portal. The Soundsslike project was also presented as an interactive installation in Koç University Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations (RCAC) and by means of an experiential exhibition at Studio-X Istanbul. In the interactive exhibition, visitors could form the soundscape of the exhibition space by playing 3 sounds of their choice at the same time. Moreover, sounds that were uploaded to Soundsslike archive by participants took place also in the exhibition area so that participants became a part of the exhibition. In the experiential exhibition, however, visitors had the chance to experience the cultural sounds that are lost in the chaos of the city by the clues in the installation.",

    "project_description": "In recent years urban open space has increasingly been under threat of being developed: One example is Gezi Park, one of the last remaining green spaces in central Istanbul, which is subject to redevelopment plans since 2013. Other well-known cases are the park that had to make way for the railway project Stuttgart 21, Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City or Tempelhofer Feld in Berlin. Cases like these repeatedly become a flashpoint for debates on private development, on the value of urban green space, on housing deficit ? to name a few causes. The research project ?In Touch with Debate? intends to trace such an urban controversy as it unfolds. It aims at capturing the complexity of today?s urban transformation process and at making it graspable.\r\n \r\nMauerpark (or ?Berlin Wall Park?), an eight-hectare public park located on a part of the so-called ?death strip? along the former Berlin Wall, served as a case study. In the early 1990s this piece of land has been transformed from a no-man?s land into a meeting and recreational space popular with locals and tourists alike. In 2012, plans emerged to build a residential complex with more than 700 apartments at the northern edge of the park. This proposal sparked a vigorous debate, which also surfaced on the internet. This research project intends to map this controversy and explore how the issue has been negotiated on the internet during the years 2013 through 2015.\r\n\r\nWithin the scope of this project the controversy data is transformed into physical three-dimensional network structures. Physical data visualization serves as an analytical tool as well as a communication aid to observe, study, grasp and communicate such a complex negotiation process involving diverse stakeholders. For the implementation of this approach a modular connector system was developed.",

    "project_description": "?City in a Room? \r\n\r\nThe concept of the Project:\r\n?City in a Room? presents a series of multimedia exhibitions that simultaneously document the architectural image and the civil experience of one city. Through this project, Buro501 aims to point out the importance of citizen participation in the creation and change of urban spaces and to further examine the genuine local sentiment for built environment. \r\nThe performance is interactive and is carried out through a dual technique ? digital media and hand drawing. Based on the great importance of an open dialog between the architectural space and the public, the project focuses on exterior facades as its primary visual element. Authors, as architects document the actual state of the cities using technical drawings of street facades, that are afterwards compressed into a video. As the video slowly, horizontally moves through the exhibition space, the visitors are invited to spontaneously and immediately react to the city that surrounds them. \r\nBy drawing manually over the projected facades, the visitors, both literally and symbolically, try to seize the cityscape that perpetually escapes their influence. In the process of common creation of a new image of the city, the authors and visitors criticize the exclusion of citizens (and architects) from a chaotic and often incomprehensible contemporary urban development. When the video projection is shut down, an image of a city that was spontaneously created by a cooperative civil community remains as a final product. \r\n\r\nPast exhibitions:\r\nA series of exhibitions began with a performance entitled  ?Belgrade in a Room? at The Prague Quadrennial 2015 within the Serbian national delegation, that won The Gold Medal for Provoking a Dialog (Jun 2015, curator: Mia David).  After recognizing the universality of this issue, Buro501 later exhibits at the Urbanize! Festival of urban practices in Vienna (?Vienna in a Room?, October 2015, curator: Elke Rauth), then at the 32. International festival Sarajevo Winter in Sarajevo (?Sarajevo in a Room?, March 2016, curator: Ibrahim Spahic) and, finally, at the XXI Triennale di Milano (?Milan in a Room? at the International Exhibition ?Design after Design?, September 2016, curator: Stefano Micelli for ?New Craft?).\r\n \r\nVisitors' reaction:\r\nDuring our past exhibitions, the visitors were often  instantly drawn by the sight of  graphic display that is irretrievably  passing by. Almost by reflex, they get directly engaged in the interaction with the video or at least linger to observe other people's reaction. Once participants recognize a familiar scenery in form and scale that is possible to manipulate, they immediately respond in different ways. Some visitors simply redraw the most impressive contours, while others try to modify or add different ones. Photographs from the past performances can only partially depict the atmosphere that emerges once the crowd is captivated. Moreover, organizers along with the media, were usually very pleased with visitors' response and the atmosphere, which was always followed by wide exposure of performances in related magazines and blogs. The installation is also found to be quite photogenic, since both professional photographers and participants enjoy taking pictures of it or with it.\r\nAfter the intervention, the visual imprints of creative thoughts remain as physical results of the interactive performance. Based on the elusive image of the actual state, we create a new image of the city that consists of various personal reactions. Some of those might make one smile, while others would raise (important) questions of urban space.  However, in that specific moment of shared creativity we can only sense empathy and solidarity, because above all - cities are about people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our strong hope is to conduct such performance as 'Berlin in a Room' and explore how people of Berlin experience and imagine their urban setting, and genuinely present this impervious sensation.\r\n",

    "project_description": "Objects in the Mirror are Closer than They Appear  is an animation by CLUSTER that uses visual media  to illustrate the dynamics and movement at the interfaces that connect formal and informal areas. Informality is one of Cairo's defining features, with blurred distinctions between formal systems and informal practices, both politico-economically and spatially. The physical manifestations of this dichotomy are often contested sites of competing interests that display the extremes of urban inequality. However, it is also in their fluid conditions that resilient, sustainable and practical solutions can be most productively explored. As the excluded communities reclaim their rights to services by finding makeshift solutions, these interfaces develop beyond spatial barriers symbolic of structural division, and may present opportunities for connection and reclamation of agency. The animation, and the research from which it developed, seek to  challenge the perceived distinction, and divisions, between one area and the other, showing the ways in which they are interconnected.\r\n\r\nObjects in the Mirror are Closer than They Appear  depicts a journey from the Mutamidiyah informal neighborhood to Tahrir Square, and the multiple modes of transportation typically required in the daily commute from informal peri-urban areas towards the center involves. The journey exemplifies the negative impacts of current policies that marginalize informal areas, excluding them from the benefits of formal services, such as metro stations, amongst others. This animation illustrates the common landscapes between the formal and informal and challenges the duality between formal and informal areas, as upheld by public perception and state policies. This animation is part of CLUSTER?s research project Formal-Informal Interface: A Comparative Research in Three Egyptian Cities  (2018), supported by the African Urban Research Initiative (AURI): Fostering a Comparative Research Agenda in African Cities.\r\n\r\nThrough the research, CLUSTER comparatively investigated the relevance of the formal-informal interface in Cairo, Alexandria and Minya, examining the conditions of borders, crossings, activities and flows that connect these areas rather than treating them as two discrete entities, thus challenging the perceived dichotomy between informal and formal areas. While unequal distribution of resources defines the formal-informal border, informal communities have demonstrated an ability to transcend a condition of marginality, and access resources that were planned to bypass their neighborhoods. Individuals cross from the informal into the formal areas, either to access education and health services or for employment in the formal market. However, these crossings are also not limited to these specific instances: informality has demonstrated an ability to adapt to existing conditions and overlap creatively with the formal city, as illustrated by CLUSTER?s previous research on street vendors (Nagati and Stryker,  Street Vendors and the Contestation of Public Space, 2017). As such, whilst research on informality has generally overlooked the relationship between informal and formal zones,  Objects in the Mirror are Closer than They Appear,  and its corresponding research, highlight the interface between formal and informal as a permeable one, grounded in the recognition of the adaptable nature of informality and the possibility it presents in informing socially just urban policy.",

Over time and across various sectors of development, Mattancherry has constantly been at the centre of multiple government initiatives but with very limited results to show on the ground. A parallel narrative also emerged with projects that did get implemented but which did not necessarily respond to the dire needs of the residents. And lastly, a third storyline revealed that irrespective of the state intervention (or lack thereof), the various individuals and communities of Mattancherry have always demonstrated the ability to organise themselves to produce or co-produce the city for its residents.",

The song represents a metaphor for São Paulo's atmosphere and feelings in a concrete, grey, rainy city. 'Amor SP' is an on-going research on data analytics, social media and open-source data in the city of São Paulo. The project explores the idea of mapping feelings and reactions to urban spaces in the city by scraping social media geolocated tags in combination with open data sources. These first images present the amount of love and hate (and related feelings) tracked from Twitter and Flickr. The background map (streets layer, districts layer and city border) are available on the Geosampa database. The criminality levels are published statistics from the Public Security Secretary (SSP/SP) in terms of occurrences by Police Station, 93 in total. Three crimes are mapped: homicides, homicide attempt, and rape. The tools used in this analysis are QGIS, Rhinoceros + Grasshopper + Mosquito, and Illustrator.\r\nThe goal of the project is to understand through mapping the complexity of the city identifying urban configurations that are favourable for human interactions, and are safe and inclusive.\r\nMais amor por favor (more love please) is a sentence from artist Ygor Marotta, which can be found on the walls of São Paulo.",
